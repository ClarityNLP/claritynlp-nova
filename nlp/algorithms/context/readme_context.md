FROM MIXTRAL NEED TO VERIFY

This code is a Python script for extracting context features from a given sentence with respect to a target phrase. The context features include temporality (recent, historical, or hypothetical), experiencer (patient or other), and negation (affirmed, negated, or possible). The script uses regular expressions to match specific patterns in the sentence and identify the context features.

Here is a breakdown of the code:

- The script imports several modules, including re, os, traceback, Enum, and a custom logging module claritynlp_logging.
- The SCRIPT_DIR variable is set to the directory of the current script.
- Several regular expressions are compiled and stored as variables, including over_several_period_rule, for_the_past_period_rule, space_rule, and phrase_regex.
- The negative_window variable is set to 4, indicating the number of words to consider before a negation trigger.
- The all_terms dictionary is initialized as an empty dictionary.
- The inited variable is initialized as False, indicating whether the terms have been loaded.
- The load_terms function takes a key as input and returns a list of triggers for that key by reading from a text file located in the data directory.
- The context_init function initializes the all_terms dictionary by loading the triggers for the "negated", "experiencier", "historical", and "hypothetical" keys using the load_terms function.
- The ContextFeature class is a data class that stores the target phrase, matched phrase, sentence, evaluation sentence, and context type.
- The ContextResult class is a data class that stores the phrase, sentence, temporality, experiencer, and negation.
- The Temporality, Experiencer, and Negation classes are enumerations that define the possible values for temporality, experiencer, and negation, respectively.
- The feature_map dictionary maps the context feature names to their corresponding enumeration values.
- The windows dictionary maps the context feature names to their corresponding window sizes.
- The stop_trigger function checks if a token is a stop trigger, i.e., a token that indicates the end of a phrase.
- The run_individual_context function takes a sentence, target phrase, key, rules, and phrase_regex as input and returns a list of ContextFeature objects. The function first preprocesses the sentence and target phrase by replacing the target phrase with a special token and adding punctuation marks. Then, the function applies the rules for the given key to the preprocessed sentence and identifies the matched phrases. Finally, the function identifies the context features for each matched phrase using the phrase_regex and returns a list of ContextFeature objects.
- The replace_all_matches function replaces all matches of a regular expression with a specified replacement string.
- The replace_dash_as_negation function replaces a dash preceding a word with "no" as a negation indicator.
- The replace_future_occurrence_as_current_negation function replaces future occurrences of a term with a current negation.
- The Context class is the main class that runs the context feature extraction. The __init__ function initializes the terms attribute by calling the context_init function. The run_context function takes a sentence and expected term as input and returns a ContextResult object. The function first preprocesses the sentence and expected term using the replace_dash_as_negation and replace_future_occurrence_as_current_negation functions. Then, the function identifies the context features using the run_individual_context function and sets the temporality, experiencer, and negation based on the identified features. Finally, the function returns a ContextResult object.
- The script includes a main block that creates an instance of the Context class and applies it to several example sentences with different target phrases. The resulting ContextResult objects are printed using the log function.
