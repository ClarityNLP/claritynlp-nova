 Inclusion Criteria: 1. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1. 2. Patients must be >/= 18 years of age. There will be no upper age restriction. 3. Cytologic or histologic proof of adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. Patients can have tumor originating in any part of the pancreas. Islet cell tumors are not eligible.
 Only patients with non- metastatic, unresectable disease (American Joint Committee on
 Cancer (AJCC) 2002 stage T4 NX M0) are eligible. Patients who cannot undergo resection because of underlying medical problems are also eligible. Patients with regional nodal disease are eligible. 4. All patients must be staged with a physical exam, chest x-ray/CXR, and contrast-enhanced helical thin-cut abdominal CT. Unresectability is defined by CT criteria: a) evidence of tumor extension to the celiac axis or superior mesenteric (SM) artery, or b) evidence on either CT or angiogram of occlusion of the SM vein or
 SM/ portal vein confluence. If a tumor does not meet this definition and is found to be unresectable at surgical exploration, then that tumor is considered unresectable. 5. Patients may have received prior chemotherapy but not prior radiation therapy to the upper abdomen. 6. Bone marrow function: absolute neutrophil count (ANC) >1,500/ul. Platelets
 >100,000/ul. 7. Hepatic function: Total bilirubin less than 1.5mg/dL. If the patient required an endobiliary stent and/or external biliary drain, the bilirubin level must have declined on consecutive measurements indicating adequate biliary decompression; alanine aminotransferase (ALT) </= 5 times the upper limit of normal. 8. Renal function: Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) </= 30 mg% and creatinine </= 1.5 mg% 9. Patients must be willing to sign informed consent indicating that they are aware of the investigational nature of the study, and are aware that participation is voluntary.

 -  Sacroiliac joint assessment 1. Posterior pelvic pain provocation test (P4) 2. Gaenslens test. 3. Compression of ASIS 4. Distraction SIJ pain provocation test 5. Assessment of Sulci depth in lumbar spine in neutral and extension
 -  Functional pelvic test 6.Active straight leg raise test (ASLR).
 -  Pain history (according to the criteria of Ostgaard) 7.It is recommended that a pain history be taken with specific attention paid to pain patterns and irritability of PGP. 8.There must be no nerve root syndrome. 9.The severity of pain must be related to motion.
 -  The diagnosis of PGP will be made if the patient has 2 or more of criteria 1-4 (Laslett's criteria) in combination with a negative McKenzie and negative neurological examination. Criteria 5-9 will be performed and assessed to try and improve diagnostic sensitivity and specificity as well as help exclude other pathologies that may cause pelvic and back pain.

 Eligibility Criteria:
 -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Criteria for diagnosis are as per the WHO classification of hematologic tumors (Jaffe 2001). As per the 1996 NCI guidelines for CLL [second-line or later] treatment of CLL is generally palliative in intent; therefore, patients who have relapsed may be followed without therapy until they experience disease-related symptoms or progressive disease, with deterioration of blood counts, discomfort from lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly, recurrent infections, or associated autoimmune disorders (Cheson 1996).
 -  Age >18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the use of high-dose simvastatin in patients <18 years of age, children are excluded from this study.

 -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:
 -  total bilirubin within normal institutional limits unless resulting from documented hemolysis
 -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) 1.5 X institutional upper limit of normal

 -  creatinine clearance >60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal
 -  Creatine phosphokinase  1.5 institutional upper limit of normal
 -  Patients with active infections requiring systemic antibiotics should be excluded until resolution of infection
 -  The effects simvastatin on the developing human fetus at the studied therapeutic dose are unknown. For this reason and because HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors may be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.

 Inclusion Criteria: 1. AJCC Stage III melanoma with clinically evident (macroscopic) disease, either by physical examination or on conventional imaging, or AJCC stage IV melanoma with metastatic site(s) considered surgically resectable. The initial decision regarding surgical candidacy should be made by surgical oncologist. Patients with indeterminate
 CT findings that are larger than 1 cm outside of the field of the potential surgery will be also included. 2. Contrast- enhanced CT of chest, abdomen and pelvis performed either at MDACC or outside of the institution should indicate surgical candidacy. Outside CT imaging studies should be of acceptable quality, as determined by the evaluating radiologist.
 PET-CT per protocol must be performed within 30 days from the contrast-enhanced CT. 3. 3. Age >/= 18. All minor patients will be excluded to avoid excessive radiation dose.
 There is data suggesting small but statistically significant increased risk for secondary malignancy due to the cumulative dose of radiation exposure associated with diagnostic imaging. Children are most sensitive to radiation long term adverse effects. Therefore current pilot study will accrue adults only. If the result of this study will indicate potential advantage of PET-CT, this data can be weighted against radiation exposure risks to decide upon imaging strategies in pediatric patients with melanoma.

NCT00832533,ct_inc_530082,2018-10-25T00:00:00Z,Clinical Trial Inclusion Criteria,ct_inc_530082,AACT,"
 Inclusion Criteria: 1. Light-skinned volunteers (Caucasians including Hispanics with slightly darker complexion) 2. 18 years of age (5 men and 5 women) 3. Resident in the State of New Mexico 4. Indoor workers with no significant history of prolonged, excessive sun exposure 5. Willing to have a monthly blood draw 6. Willing to fill out the sun diary every day on different indoor/outdoor activities. 7. During the project time period potential pregnancy of women volunteers would change the risk category of the participants, and that is a reportable event to UNM HSC HRRC and the Clinical Trial Office.
 Further explanation of the inclusion criteria:
 This pilot study is intended to evaluate the dose-response associations between measured UV exposure and individual serum 25 (OH)-vitamin D levels. To date, there is little data and a great deal of mis-information about vitamin D. Caucasians have a variety of skin types and melanin production. This pilot study is unfunded and we know that there is extreme heterogeneity among Caucasians in their absorption of UVB and subsequent synthesis of vitamin D. Among our volunteers 2 participants with Hispanic ethnicity are represented as well. Darker-skinned individuals, such as African Americans, produce considerably less vitamin D, based on the bone health literature. Inclusion of African Americans will be critical in the future as we develop our understanding of the relationship between vitamin
 D and UV exposure. Our collaborator, Elizabeth Jacobs at the University of Arizona, is currently conducting a pilot study to evaluate UV and serum vitamin D among individuals with darker pigmentation. The motivation for our pilot study has to do with the balance between vitamin D and sun exposure as a risk-benefit assessment for the development of melanoma. Asians and African Americans do develop melanoma, but at a rate ten times less than Caucasians and it does not appear to be related to sun exposure; thus, to include them at this time would not allow us to focus on the medically-related issue.

 Exclusion Criteria: 1. WISC-III full-scale IQ less than 80. 2. Major acute or chronic medical condition, including sensory loss, and neurological disorder, or any medical condition that would preclude the use of stimulant medication. 3. Comorbidity: The study rationale for inclusion/exclusion of comorbid psychological/psychiatric conditions is as follows: children for whom the study treatment is contraindicated, or for whom treatment not provided in the study is required immediately, will not be entered in the trial. Thus, as an example, comorbid depression or anxiety disorder is permitted provided immediate treatment of the depressive or anxiety disorder is not required. Tic disorders of mild to moderate severity, and stable, would be eligible for inclusion, as this would not constitute a contraindication to receiving stimulants. However, children with pronounced or unstable tics would not be eligible for the trial.
 Children with any of the following conditions will be excluded from the study: psychosis, any pervasive developmental disorder, and bipolar disorder. Thus children will be permitted in the study if they have a comorbid learning disability, oppositional defiant disorder, or conduct disorder. The Wechsler Individual
 Achievement Tests will be administered in order that we can characterize our sample with respect to the presence of comorbid learning disabilities. 4. Concomitant medications: Systemically absorbed medication will be exclusionary, while non-systemically absorbed medications will generally be permitted. Children who have taken any experimental medication in the past month will be excluded.

The system uses a standard guide wire to position the Intelligent Drug Delivery Catheter across the length of the target clot. The guide wire is introduced through the popliteal vein. Along the guide wire the catheter is positioned. The location of the dispersion catheter is controlled and if necessary adjusted by X-ray. The guide wire is then pulled out and replaced with the Microsonic core (a miniscule high frequency (2MHz) ultrasound transducer). The system automatically monitors and controls the microsonic energy delivery. This system does not fragment the thrombus but only gives a structural change by which a better penetration of the thrombolytic agent is achieved."

 Osteoporosis in postmenopausal women is one of the most important public health challenges of our time. With millions of women affected and billions of dollars being spent for its complications, we need to develop effective approaches to this disease. Postmenopausal women are at particular risk because the loss of estrogen associated with the menopause leads to bone loss of much greater magnitude than one would expect on the basis of age alone. Estrogen replacement therapy, a logical and effective therapeutic approach, has been associated with serious concerns about adverse events and, thus, limited use. The recent development of selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMS) may help if they continue to show promise.
 Interest in natural sources of estrogenic substances to prevent postmenopausal bone loss is an expected outgrowth of the general interest in alternative medicinals for a wide variety of human disorders. Concerns about the potential for adverse consequences of the conventional use of estrogen replacement therapy, and limited knowledge about long term use of SERMS- add support to this quest. No systematic investigation of the role of dietary phytoestrogens on bone mass and skeletal dynamics has yet been conducted. With the dramatic increase in interest in these sources of estrogenic activity, it is important for us to determine whether these agents are efficacious. Otherwise, this field will be plagued for years to come by incomplete, anecdotal and scientifically poorly documented actions of these agents on bone metabolism. It is our expectation that this study will begin to provide the documentary information that the field so clearly needs. The rationale for exploring the potential for phytoestrogens in the maintenance of skeletal health in postmenopausal women is clear and compelling.
 Women will be randomly assigned to one of three healthy eating plans and, over the course of the year-long study, will learn to choose and cook foods to help optimize health as they go through menopause and beyond."

 OBJECTIVE: This is a natural history/disease pathogenesis protocol for evaluation of patients with or at risk for acute stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), or other disturbances of cerebrovascular circulation. The purpose of this protocol is to generate natural history data to serve as the basis for future hypothesis-driven protocols as well as to contribute to the clinical and physiological understanding of cerebrovascular disease through the description of disease manifestations and the relationship among clinical, hematologic, and radiologic variables, as well as identifying potential subjects for future studies on stroke and other cerebrovascular diseases.
 STUDY POPULATIONS: Patients will be recruited from the collaborative stroke program between
 NINDS and affiliated hospitals and will be followed for the duration of their hospitalization. Select subjects will then be seen for follow for up to one year.
 DESIGN: Clinical issues to be addressed will include disease manifestations, natural history, acute disease management, and psychological/behavioral impact of the disease. Because of the nature of acute cerebrovascular disease, it is important to note that the research performed under this protocol will not interfere with emergency clinical evaluation or treatment of subjects, as specified in the clinical care pathway in place for the standard care of stroke patients at participating hospitals. Due to the emergency nature of clinical evaluation and therapy for stroke patients, waiver of written informed consent in certain circumstances for minimal risk procedures during acute period (e.g., collecting extra tubes of blood during initial phlebotomy for emergency room blood tests) will be required when it is impossible to obtain consent prior to critical emergency treatment procedures that may change the values of the variables. Patients will not be treated with experimental therapies as part of this protocol. Data collected under this protocol may be shared with other NIH researchers and databases and the National Institutes of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) Repository if the subject approves this option in the informed consent.
 OUTCOME MEASURES: In addition to clinical, imaging and laboratory data that are part of routine clinical care of the patient, a variety of outcomes will be collected, e.g., infarct volume, clinical outcomes on NIH Stroke Scale, modified Rankin Score, Barthel Index, blood marker of inflammation, coagulation and gene expression. Statistical analysis plans will be developed as specific questions and hypotheses are generated."

 Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most common childhood psychiatric disorder, present in between 3 to 10% of children in the United States (Wender et al 2001).
 It is thought to reflect subtle anomalies in the central nervous system and thus structural neuroimaging has been used extensively to delineate the neurobiology of the disorder.
 Magnetic resonance imaging has demonstrated structural anomalies in ADHD, affecting all the major lobes with particularly severe volume reductions in the cerebellum and relative preservation of the caudate nucleus (for a review see Durston 2003). In structural neuroimaging work, studies with monozygotic twins who are discordant for the disorder have proved a particularly powerful tool, with findings of a significantly smaller caudate nucleus in the affected twin compared to the unaffected, but genetically identical, twin (Castellanos et al 2003). We have previously reported an overall reduction in white matter volume in all four major brain lobes, with the deficit appearing to be fixed and non-progressive. However, recent advances in neuroimaging of white matter make feasible an examination of white matter characteristics, such as the degree of myelination and the coherence of white matter tracts.
 The proposed project builds on our anatomic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies that have been performed with a 1.5-Tesla scanner in children who have
 Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and normal controls. We now propose to use diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DT-MRI) as conventional T(1)- and T(2)-weighted images at 3-Tesla to visualize and quantify white matter tracts in the brains of normal monozygotic (MZ) twins, MZ twins who are concordant for ADHD, and MZ twins who are discordant for ADHD. Ages will range from 6 to 21 years. Our principal focus will be on development and possible abnormalities of white matter tracts linking prefrontal-striatal-thalamic circuits in which we hypothesize disruption of these tracts in affected twins relative to their healthy co-twins. We will also explore the usefulness of this technique in delineating white matter in cerebellar circuits and characterize the normal development of white matter from ages 6 to 21 by using a single healthy twin per family."

 Although the cause of cryoglobulinemic vasculitis is not known, a critical component is the presence of cryoglobulins-abnormal proteins that white blood cells called B lymphocytes produce in response to the chronic hepatitis C infection. Rituximab decreases the number of B cells. The Food and Drug Administration approved Rituximab in 1997 for the treatment of
 B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
 Patients between 18 and 75 years of age with hepatitis C and signs and symptoms of cryoglobulinemic vasculitis may be eligible for this study.

 A substantial proportion of patients on antiretroviral therapy do not achieve sustained suppression of HIV viral load. Developing strategies to improve responses to subsequent regimens is an important objective for the management of patients with HIV infection.
 Increasing the potency of regimens by using a pharmacoenhancer such as RTV is of interest.
 RTV is used widely to increase plasma concentrations of PIs, but there is little efficacy and tolerability data about different RTV-enhanced PIs. The efficacy and tolerability of a triple
 PI regimen will be compared to dual PI regimens; dual PI regimens will also be compared to each other.
 In Step 1, patients will be selectively randomized (based on prior exposure to the study drugs) and enrolled into 1 of 3 study arms. Patients in Arm A will receive lopinavir (LPV)/RTV in combination with TDF and 1 or 2 other NRTIs; patients in Arm B will receive fosamprenavir plus RTV in combination with TDF and 1 or 2 other NRTIs; Arm C patients were to receive LPV/RTV plus fosamprenavir in combination with TDF and 1 or 2 other NRTIs. Because interim study results indicated that mean PI levels for patients in Arm C were unacceptably low, Arm C patients will now either drop LPV/RTV and add RTV or drop fosamprenavir from their regimens.
 The study will last 24 to 48 weeks. Medications and clinical assessment and blood collection will be performed at 2 weeks prior to entry, entry, and Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 40, and 48.

 Background:
 The purpose of this study is to design and evaluate targeted implementation strategies to fully integrate the VHA clinical practice guidelines for ischemic heart disease into VHA clinical practice. Effectively implementing the guideline will enhance the quality, appropriateness, timeliness, and cost effectiveness of care delivered to veterans with ischemic heart disease.
 Objectives:
 The long-term objective of this study is to identify the best strategies for implementing the
 IHD guidelines to improve guideline adherence and provider acceptance. The specific objectives of the study are to: 1) describe the temporal aspects of guideline acceptance and adherence over three periods of time: pre-implementation, post-implementation of general strategies, and post- implementation of targeted strategies; 2) assess the relative effectiveness of targeted intervention strategies on guideline adherence; 3) identify the relationships among provider beliefs, attitudes, and their intentions to use guidelines; 4) identify the costs associated with implementation of general and targeted implementation strategies; and 5) describe provider satisfaction with targeted implementation strategies.
 Methods:
 Qualitative (focus groups, interviews with key informants) and quantitative methods (surveys, chart reviews) are used to address study objectives. A survey will be sent to providers to measure beliefs and attitudes that predict provider acceptance to clinical practice guidelines. Patient level data will be collected from reviews of charts from each facility.
 Based on provider focus groups we will design targeted strategies to overcome system barriers and address needs identified by providers to support clinical practice guideline implementation. A randomized trial will be conducted to assess the relative effectiveness of the targeted intervention strategies.
 Status:
 Data collection has ended. We are currently evaluating adherence data at all sites following introduction of case management to determine if the intervention increases adherence to the guidelines."

 Older African American women suffer from disproportionately high rates of cardiovascular (CVD) morbidity and mortality compared to white Americans. Numerous controlled studies suggest that this disparity is associated with chronic psychosocial and environmental stress.
 Research indicates that Transcendental Meditation (TM) may result in significant improvements in CVD risk factors in this high risk population.
 Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to either active stress reduction with
 TM or health education control, both in addition to usual medical care, for 12 months. The primary outcome will be carotid artery atherosclerosis (IMT) measured non-invasively by quantitative B-mode ultrasonography. Secondary measures will include traditional CVD risk factors (blood pressure, serum glucose and insulin levels, obesity, and sedentary lifestyle), stress-related neurohormones (catecholamine metabolite and cortisol), psychosocial stress, and quality of life. The results of this trial will yield valuable new knowledge for the prevention of CVD through a CAM intervention in high risk older African American women."

 Congestive heart failure is a serious health problem in the United States and is associated with excessive morbidity and mortality. Several classes of medications have been shown to improve mortality in patients with CHF. Despite this these medications are widely under prescribed. Guidelines have been shown to improve patient outcomes and several guidelines on the management of CHF have been published. Implementation of guidelines is challenging and most strategies have focused on changing physician behavior. Patient-based interventions have been shown to be effective in implementing guidelines on CHF but they have been very labor intensive. A computer based intervention to implement CHF guidelines, if effective, would be beneficial.
 Objectives:
 Patients with CHF consume a significant proportion of healthcare resources, with exacerbations of CHF being the second most common reason for medical admission to VA medical centers. Therefore, the main objective is to understand the impact of a tailored education message program designed for direct use by patients on medical resource use. Other objectives include understanding the tools impact on patient compliance and quality of life.
 Methods:
 Patients have been randomized to one of two groups: 1) intervention group or the 2) control group. The intervention group receives the tailored education messages program. This program assesses patients� beliefs about compliance with medications, diet, and self-monitoring.
 Based on identified barriers to compliance, intervention patients receive a tailored educational message to dispel these beliefs and improve compliance. The control group interacts with a generic healthcare website. Patients in both groups are monitored for hospitalization; emergent care visits, compliance with prescribed treatment and quality of life
 Status:
 Project work is ongoing."

 Background:
 Despite the development of significant pharmaceutical treatments, morbidity and mortality of chronic heart failure (CHF) patients remain high, patients� quality of life is poor, and their health care utilization is heavy. It is therefore important to find a cost effective non-pharmaceutical treatment to help CHF patients manage the disease. The relaxation response has been found to be effective in managing CHF-related conditions. With its favorable physiological changes, the relaxation response is likely to benefit CHF patients.
 Objectives: 1. To evaluate the effects of a 15-week relaxation response intervention program on improving functional capacity and health-related quality of life as compared with an ongoing 15-week educational program for cardiac disease management, and a control group of usual cardiac care; 2. To identify the costs of conducting the intervention and the cardiac care education and the costs associated with cardiac care services; and to compare cost among three study groups.
 Methods:
 This is a single-blind three-armed randomized trial in CHF patients who receive care at the
 Boston VA Medical Center. Enrolled patients are randomly assigned, with equal numbers, to one of the three study groups. Outcomes include cardiac functional capacity and self-reported health-related quality of life. We also conduct a qualitative study to interview patients by phone about their experience in the study.

 In an HIV-infected person, there is an ongoing struggle between HIV replication and host immune control. In the past decade most therapeutic strategies have targeted the virus. This approach has been frustrated by viral mutation to evade drug sensitivity. Promising drugs have recently been approved and there are encouraging sustained results from combination antiviral chemotherapy. However, even the most potent drug regimens do not seem to be curative, may eventually lead to drug resistance and may not completely restore lost immune function. The addition of immune-based therapy to antiviral drugs may lead to better viral control.
 This study has 2 regimens of 8 patients each. Patients are randomized as to CTL infusion only. Patients are stratified by viral load (less than 10,000 copies/ml vs. greater than or equal to 10,000 copies/ml). All patients receive combination drug therapy with
 AZT/3TC/indinavir for 9 months at which time patients have the option of continuing their study regimen another year or changing therapy. Patients in the T cell treatment regimen (regimen 2) receive 2 infusions of ex vivo expanded autologous anti-HIV CTL at 3 and 6 months after beginning AZT/3TC/indinavir therapy.

 BACKGROUND:
 Supplemental vitamin E has been associated with a reduced risk of recurrent myocardial infarctions, with efficacy related to dosage and the duration of treatment. Its effects may be enhanced by vitamin C, an antioxidant that can regenerate vitamin E activity.
 Theoretically vitamin E and C (VitE/C) accumulate in the vascular wall with a concurrent reduction in oxidative damage, a primary feature of atherosclerotic lesions. Estrogen/hormone replacement therapy (HRT) also may reduce oxidative damage, and it may enhance the effect of vitamin E and C. These hypotheses are supported by studies defining oxidation-dependent accumulation of lipids in developing atherosclerosis; the detection of oxidative damage products, such as oxidized-LDL particles, in human atherosclerotic lesions; and clinical studies associating antioxidant or estrogen supplementation with reductions in oxidative damage cardiovascular disease. Nevertheless, no human studies have evaluated the effect of long-term VitE/C treatment, which has been reported as being the most effective prevention factor by epidemiologic studies, on specific. biochemical markers of oxidative damage and concurrently their association with recurrent cardiovascular disease. In addition, no studies have characterized the effect of long-term HRT on markers of oxidative damage or HRT's potential synergistic effect with VitE/C therapy.
 DESIGN NARRATIVE:
 The study assayed specific biochemical measures of oxidative damage (all markers at closeout and nitrotyrosine and chlorotyrosine also at baseline) in the Women's Angiographic Vitamin and Estrogen (WAVE) Trial, which randomized 420 38-86 year old women with a prior cardiovascular disease event to placebo, Vitamin E/C, hormone replacement therapy (HRT) or the combination of VitE/C and HRT. WAVE determined the efficacy of these treatments on quantitative angiographic evaluation of minimal coronary artery diameter performed at baseline and at the final visit to be completed during the first 10 months of 2001. The ancillary study measured oxidation products from several classes of compounds (lipids by
 F2-isoprostanes, proteins by nitrotyrosine and chlorotyrosine, and DNA by 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine), thereby studying several major pathways that may lead to atherogenesis. In addition, inflammation with C-reactive protein, platelet activation with p-selectin, altered lipid metabolism with a lipid profile and other characteristics of the study population were integrated into the assessment of oxidative damage in WAVE. By measuring these various factors and by assessing oxidative damage in several classes of compounds, the authors tested the relationships among specific pathways of oxidative damage, supplemental VitE/C and/or HRT and other risk factors upon the progression of established macrovascular disease."

 BACKGROUND:
 A predominant consequence of Type 2 diabetes mellitus is accelerated development of atherosclerosis related conditions. Conventional cardiovascular risk factors only explain a portion of the excess risk for atherosclerosis in this population. This ancillary study uses the study population and framework of the V A Cooperative study of Glycemic Control and
 Complications in DM 2. The Cooperative study is a prospective, two-arm, randomized, controlled, multicenter trial to assess the effects of tight glycemic control, achieved through intensification of treatment, on clinical macrovascular and microvascular complications in patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus who are in poor glycemic control despite pharmacologic therapy. Cooperative study subjects from multiple sites (340 subjects) are participating in the trial.
 The study is in response to an initiative Ancillary Studies in Heart, Lung, and Blood
 Disease Trials released by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute in June 2000.
 DESIGN NARRATIVE:
 This ancillary study examines non traditional risk factors which may contribute to accelerated cardiovascular disease in Type 2 diabetes and the effects of intensive versus standard glycemic management on these risk factors. Specific short-term primary aims include determining the cross-sectional relationship between baseline levels and the presence of atherosclerosis as measured by electron beam computed tomography assessment of coronary artery (CAC) and abdominal aortic calcium (AAC) and the prevalence of clinical macrovascular disease. An estimated 340 Cooperative study subjects from multiple sites will be asked to participate in this additional study. At their baseline visit, subjects will have additional blood and urine collected for a) VLDL, IDL and LDL subfractions b) measures of in vivo oxidative stress (oxidized-phospholipids on plasma LDL, autoantibodies to epitopes of oxidized LDL, F2-isoprostane levels) c) AGE-LDL levels, and d) markers of endothelial activation/injury (PAI-1, VCAM-1 and ICAM-1) and inflammation (C-reactive protein and fibrinogen). Subjects will also have CAC and AAC determined. After enrollment in the study, participants will have measurements of cardiovascular risk factors repeated at six months.
 Primary and secondary macrovascular endpoints will be identical to those defined in the VA
 Cooperative study (Primary: myocardial infarction, cardiovascular death, stroke, congestive heart failure, invasive vascular therapy (coronary or peripheral), and amputation due to ischemic gangrene; Secondary: angina pectoris, transient ischemic attacks, and peripheral artery disease). Statistical methods, depending on the specific aim will include categorical age and sex adjusted analyses, t-tests, and multiple regression models. Long-term aims will include evaluating the prospective relationship of these novel cardiovascular risk factors to the progression of atherosclerosis and the development of macrovascular disease in this same population."

 More than 1.8 million people in the United States suffer from chronic pain and disability following motor vehicle accidents (MVAs) each year. The majority of these cases start with a relatively minor neck injury. The Quebec Task Force Study on Whiplash Associated Disorders (WAD) was created in 1989 to determine the clinical, public health, social, and financial determinants of WAD. Multiple studies have described the clinical features of WAD, which include neck, shoulder, arm, low back, and head pain; tinnitus; visual symptoms; dizziness; temporomandibular joint pain; and paraesthesias. Onset of these symptoms after the injury is usually delayed for several hours and worsens within 24 to 48 hours. Neck pain is the most frequent symptom, and between 14% and 42% of patients with WAD develop chronic neck pain symptoms. Studies suggest that the neck pain will either resolve in the first few months or persist indefinitely. One variable that may predict outcome after an MVA is the acute emotional response immediately after the MVA.
 A severe emotional reaction accompanied by neck pain and stiffness after an MVA could lead an injured person to avoid subsequent physical activity through such mechanisms as fear avoidance and fear of reinjury. Research investigating the evolution of chronic pain due to musculoskeletal injury suggests that initial emotional reactivity, particularly fear of reinjury and subsequent activity avoidance, contributes significantly to unremitting pain and persistent disability. Research based on this model has shown that early interventions targeting normalization of excessive emotionality and restriction of activities associated with fear following injury effectively prevent chronic pain due to back injury. No previous study has sought to intervene during the first three months after an MVA with a behavioral and physical exercise program to encourage activity and discourage continued fear of movement, pain and disability.
 This study consists of two primary components: (1) To compare the effectiveness of two anxiety-reduction treatments with standard care in reducing pain and activity limitations in patients with WADs 2 to 3 months following MVAs. (2) To test whether psychological responses to the initial trauma, such as fear avoidance, fear of injury, and negative affectivity, discriminate between symptomatic WAD patients and WAD sufferers whose symptoms had resolved 2 to 3 months post-MVA."

 Objective:
 The goal of this protocol is to identify families with inherited movement disorders and evaluate disease manifestations to establish an accurate clinical diagnosis, and to investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms. Studies of inherited movement disorders in large families with good genealogical records are especially valuable.
 Additionally, the plan is to screen subjects with and without Parkinson's disease for the presence of revelant antibodies, such as antibodies targeting tobacco mosaic virus antigens which may have a protective role against the development of the disease or may be related to other pathophysiologic mechanisms.
 The study will also assess a series of exploratory peripheral blood biomarkers, including, but not limited to, those delineated by DNA, RNA, protein, and/or metabolite alterations in an effort to more accurately predict those with, or at risk of having, the specific neurological disease. Finally, validation of the NIH Toolbox Odor Identification Test (NIHOIT) against the standard University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) in patients with Parkinson's Disease will be analyzed.
 Study population:
 Subjects older than 2 years old with movement disorders and their family members will be enrolled. Patients with diseases of known molecular basis will be genotyped in order to investigate phenotype/genotype correlation. Patients with disease of unknown or incomplete genetic characterization will be studied with a hope of contributing to the identification of specific disease causing genes and genetic mechanisms and/or peripheral biosignatures involved in a particular disorder.
 Design:
 Eligible participants will have an initial medical and/or neurological evaluation at the
 Clinical Center or in the field, including blood draw for genetic and other biomarker testing.
 Outcome measures:
 Determination of phenotype/genotype correlations in specific movement disorders, gene identification if not known, gene expression and protein and metabolite levels, and presence of antibodies in Parkinson's disease and establishment of a clinical diagnosis when possible."

 The aim of this research is to examine whether adding antidepressant pharmacotherapy to behavioral cessation treatment improves the depression-prone smoker's ability to quit, while not undermining cessation for the smoker who lacks a history of depression, by randomizing smokers both with and without such a history to double-blind treatment with either 60 mg fluoxetine or placebo. The primary Depressive Episode Hypothesis states that the stress of quitting smoking and the biological challenge of nicotine withdrawal trigger a depressive episode in vulnerable individuals. To the extent that episode onset can be prevented by prophylactic administration of antidepressant pharmacotherapy, smokers with a history of depression will show significantly higher abstinence rates when treated with fluoxetine than placebo, whereas no drug effect will be evident for history negative smokers who lack the depressive diathesis. An alternative generalized withdrawal hypothesis construes post-cessation dysphoria as one general manifestation of a nicotine withdrawal syndrome that occurs independently of depressive vulnerability, and predicts that fluoxetine, as compared to placebo, will uniformly improve cessation outcomes, regardless of whether smokers possess the diathesis for depression. Over period of four years, the study hopes to randomize 120 smokers with a history of depression and 120 smokers who lack such a history to double-blind treatment with either 60 mg fluoxetine or placebo, while they undergo group cognitive behavioral treatment to quit smoking. To allow plasma drug levels to stabilize before quitting smoking, drug or placebo treatment begins 3 weeks before quitting smoking and continues for an additional 8 weeks following the quit date. Participants will be followed up monthly for 4 months after the end of treatment in order to assess the main study outcome; abstinence from smoking 6 months after the quit date."

 Nosocomial infections are often caused by antimicrobial-resistant pathogens such as vancomycin resistant enterococci (VRE) and are a major cause increased morbidity, mortality and cost in hospitalized patients. Nosocomial bloodstream infections (BSI) add 7 to 21 days to the length of stay and cost institutions $3,061 to $40,000. The average cost of treating patients with VRE BSI has been estimated as 30% more than vancomycin sensitive enterococcal
 BSI. In addition, the attributable mortality of VRE BSI has been estimated as 37%. Preventing
 VRE infection and VRE transmission is clearly important and understanding the risk factors for each is a necessary first step. The goal of this three year study is to identify potentially effective interventions for the prevention of VRE infection and colonization
 Before testing interventions, we need to identify risk factors for VRE infection which will allow us to (1) identify potentially effective interventions and (2) focus on patients at highest risk for VRE infection. We will study the effect of antibiotic use, particularly vancomycin, and impaired host defenses on VRE infection in a large cohort study of VRE colonized patients. The goal is to develop a statistical model, which will allow us to identify alterable risk factors, which could reduce the risk of VRE infection. Many case-control studies have been performed to study VRE colonization and infection; however, most of these studies were small with insufficient sample sizes for multivariate modeling.
 Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) can be transmitted from patient to patient. We propose to model the ecological relationship between the rate of VRE transmission and the pre-existing prevalence of VRE in an ICU to determine whether the relationship is linear or exponential. The objective is to determine at what point the rate of transmission increases significantly that specific interventions should occur (e.g. reverse isolation of all patients, close unit to new admissions). Controlling health care costs is an important part of health care today and is particularly important in the capitated reimbursement system that
 VHA is adopting. Potential interventions to prevent VRE infections and VRE transmission must be cost-effective to the healthcare system to justify their adoption. The current study will quantify the operational costs associated with VRE colonization and infection in hospitalized patients compared to their non-colonized counterparts. Patients from the intensive care units with and without VRE colonization will be covaried for severity of illness and stratified by
 Major Diagnostic Category (by primary ICD-9 code) and marginal health care costs compared.
 This estimate can then be used to examine the potential cost-effectiveness of identified interventions, and to justify the system-wide costs of implementing these interventions."

 Cryptosporidium parvum, an intracellular protozoan parasite, is a frequent cause of chronic diarrhea in HIV-infected patients, causing significant morbidity and mortality. Highly effective antiparasitic treatment for this infection is not currently available. Paromomycin and azithromycin have some efficacy and have been used in combination in a small number of patients. Immune reconstitution with highly active antiretroviral therapy appears to be the most effective therapy, but this is not possible for all patients. Interferon gamma expression is strongly associated with control of cryptosporidiosis, and IL-12 is the cytokine primarily responsible for stimulation of interferon gamma expression in vivo. It is hoped that treatment with recombinant human IL-12 can result in stimulation of an intestinal cytokine response in AIDS patients with cryptosporidiosis and that response combined with chemotherapy can lead to the elimination of detectable numbers of Cryptosporidium oocysts from the stools.
 All patients receive azithromycin and paromomycin, and patients are randomized to add either
 IL-12 or placebo. IL-12 (or placebo) injections are given twice a week. Patients take their study medications for 4 weeks. During this time, they will be asked to record bowel movements and any symptoms they experience. Patients return to the clinic at least twice a week to receive IL-12 (or placebo) injections. At Weeks 2 and 4, patients are seen by one of the principal investigators. Blood samples are obtained for viral load measurements and CD4 count, as well as routine urinalysis. Patients undergo upper endoscopy with jejunal biopsy and colonoscopy with ileal biopsy between Weeks 2 and 4 of therapy for assays of intestinal cytokine expression.

 Lymphocytic alveolitis in HIV-infected patients probably represents a local immune response to HIV-infected cells in the lung. The intensity of lymphocytic alveolitis may therefore reflect the viral load in the lung. If so, treatment that reduces viral load in the lung (e.g., HAART) should also decrease the number of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in the alveolar space and should return pulmonary immune responses toward normal.
 Patients are stratified by CD4 count: less than 200 cells/mm3 or 200 - 500 cells/mm3. BAL is performed and blood samples are collected prior to initiation of HAART and after 1 and 6 months of HAART. If a patient has detectable HIV in the lung after 6 months of HAART, the patient is asked to submit to an optional fourth BAL after 12 months of HAART.

Virologic failure in these patients may be a result of antiretroviral resistance, likely a result of poor adherence to the treatment regimen or inadequate dosing. This study is designed to achieve adherence through observation of drug administration for the first 8 weeks of the study and to further overcome resistance by intensive, high-dose, multi-drug therapy. Treatment with more than 4 drugs has not been studied formally in children, but pediatricians caring for children with AIDS have used such strategies off study with success. Dose intensification may also aid in overcoming resistance; therefore, in this trial, d4T, 3TC, and NFV are administered at up to twice their standard doses. Given the limited therapeutic options available to HIV-positive children with poor prognoses, high-dose, multi-drug therapy merits study. [AS PER AMENDMENT 01/07/00: Pancreatitis, which may be fatal in some cases, has occurred during therapy with ddI. The risk of pancreatitis may be increased when ddI is used in combination with HU. ACTG A5025, a study that had a d4T/ddI/HU arm, was terminated because of significant toxicity concerns related to the HU-containing arm. Patients enrolled in ACTG
 P1007 may be at increased risk of developing pancreatitis given their advanced disease state and the use of multiple drugs including HU. The study had been amended to address these concerns.] [AS PER AMENDMENT 12/19/01: HU has been removed from the drug regimen.]
 Patient enrollment is staged to allow study physicians to aggressively monitor patients for signs of toxicity. Initially, patients are admitted to a hospital or clinical research center for 2 weeks, where they initiate an [AS PER AMENDMENT 12/19/01: 8-drug regimen is replaced by 7-drug regimen] and undergo frequent physical exams and blood tests to assess [AS PER
 AMENDMENT 12/19/01: glucose levels], pharmacokinetics, virologic response, and toxicity. If investigators identify important drug interactions requiring modification of the combination regimen, or if there are early regimen-terminating toxicities, the trial will be halted to address these concerns. After 2 weeks, the patient is discharged to return home. Study personnel visit the patient's house twice a day for 6 more weeks to observe drug administration, and the patient continues to receive regular physical exams and blood tests.
 At the end of Week 24, all patients with plasma RNA levels of 10,000 copies/ml or less are offered the opportunity to continue their regimen to Week 48. Patients with plasma RNA levels above 10,000 copies/ml at Week 24 and patients who experience virologic rebound at or after
 Week 24 are taken off study unless the patient's family and the investigator feel it is in the best interest of the child to remain on study. [AS PER AMENDMENT 12/19/01: The 2-week hospital or GCRC stay is no longer required. A 2-day stay in a hospital or GCRC for the purpose of drug regimen training is recommended, but not mandatory.

 Therapeutically, there is a need to explore potent alternative therapy for patients who have received, or are currently receiving, a double nucleoside analog combination including lamivudine (3TC), a regimen that was proven to be clinically inferior to indinavir (IDV) when combined with zidovudine/3TC in study ACTG 320. In order to produce and maintain a maximal antiviral response, all patients in this study will receive 2 or 3 potent, new agents; ABC, a nucleoside analog, EFV, a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), and IDV, a protease inhibitor. Virologically, the major question this protocol seeks to answer is how prior 3TC exposure in a dual nucleoside regimen influences the response to subsequent treatment. It is unclear whether it is best to add a protease inhibitor either 1) an NNRTI at 1 of 2 doses, or 2) an NNRTI at 1 of 2 doses plus a new nucleoside analog to achieve plasma
 HIV RNA levels that are below the limits of detection.
 Prior to randomization, patients are stratified by CD4 cell count (cells/mm3): less than or equal to 50 versus greater than 50 and by ACTG 320 participation: enrolled versus not enrolled. Patients with greater than 50 CD4 cells/mm3 are randomized to 1 of 4 treatment arms (Arms I, II, III, or IV) and patients with less than or equal to 50 CD4 cells/mm3 are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms (Arms I and II). All patients will be followed for 48 weeks beyond the enrollment of the last patient. The regimens for the treatment arms are as follows: Arm I - indinavir (IDV) plus EFV plus ABC placebo bid, Arm II - IDV (higher dose) plus EFV (lower dose) plus ABC, Arm III - IDV plus EFV plus ABC placebo, and Arm IV - IDV (higher dose) plus EFV (lower dose) plus ABC. If 15 week data indicates this is a reasonable dosing regimen, the sample size in Arms III and IV will be expanded to include additional patients with a CD4 count greater than 50 cells/mm3 and allow for equal enrollment across all 4 treatment arms. Those patients who roll over from ACTG 320 will be assigned to receive open-label treatment on Arm II and evaluated independently of the 4 treatment arms listed above.
 [AS PER AMENDMENT 8/27/97: Patients with 2 consecutive HIV RNA measurements at least 500 copies/ml at week 16 or anytime thereafter are given the option to receive open-label treatment with IDV plus EFV plus ABC, or to seek the best available therapy outside of the study. NOTE: Patients who choose the open-label combination may take other prescribed nucleoside analogs provided outside the study.] [AS PER AMENDMENT 12/17/97: It is strongly recommended that patients who reach a confirmed endpoint and elect to receive open-label therapy consider adding additional approved (and novel, if possible) antiretroviral agents to their open-label regimen.] [AS PER AMENDMENT 1/12/98: Patients who choose the open-label combination may receive other approved antiretrovirals obtained outside the study provided the ACTG 368 team approves the combination.] [AS PER AMENDMENT 8/7/98: Subjects will take study medications for a maximum of 96 weeks, depending on their time of study enrollment.]
 [AS PER AMENDMENT 3/10/99: A 24-week extension, which will end July 30, 1999, has been added to the study. The extension applies to subjects currently on blinded Step 1 treatment, on open-labeled Step 2, or on study but off treatment. Subjects are to be unblinded in their study treatment and followed for the remainder of the extension. Subjects continue on their current study drug schedule. Subjects on blinded IDV plus EFV who, upon unblinding (not failure) decide to add prescription ABC to their regimen, will be considered off study treatment and will be followed for the duration of the extension; those already registered on
 Step 2 will continue their Step 2 therapy. Any subject who does not wish to continue on the study extension will be unblinded to their original randomized regimen. Subjects who experience virologic failure during the extension should seek best available treatment following current recommendations to use as many approved, novel antiretroviral agents as possible. The new drug regimen may incorporate any or all of the study drugs.]"

 Although dramatic inhibition of HIV-1 replication is achieved with ritonavir or indinavir monotherapy, in both cases maximum suppression required combination treatment together with nucleoside analog RT inhibitors. This study tests the hypothesis that monotherapy with 141W94 doses that result in Cmin levels far in excess of the IC90 corrected for plasma protein binding for HIV-1 can achieve the same virologic and immunologic effects in terms of magnitude and durability, as has been observed with combinations of other protease inhibitors plus nucleoside analogs.
 In this randomized, double-blind study, patients' HIV RNA is screened 30 days prior to entry.
 Patients satisfying enrollment criteria must have been on a stable antiretroviral regimen for 30 days prior to study screening and remain on the same regimen until entry. Patients are stratified based on the screening HIV-1 RNA copy number obtained within 30 days of entry: 5,000 - 50,000 copies/ml versus greater than 50,000 copies/ml. In addition, patients are stratified based on previous antiretroviral use: naive versus experienced. Patients are randomized to one of 2 treatment arms: Arm A - 141W94, plus Zidovudine (ZDV) and Lamivudine (3TC) or Arm B - 141W94, plus ZDV placebo and 3TC placebo.

 Dendritic cells are a type of white blood cell used by the body to fight infection. They are instrumental in presenting antigens (such as HIV antigens) to the body's immune system. Since dendritic cells are not functioning maximally in HIV-infected patients, infusion of dendritic cells from an HIV-negative sibling may enable the affected sibling's immune system to recognize foreign particles more readily and increase immune response against the virus.
 Dendritic cells from an HIV-negative sibling are obtained and treated with various viral proteins (HIV vaccines) or immunomodulators. The treated dendritic cells are infused into the
 HIV-infected patient monthly for 6 months. Siblings must be able to donate on multiple occasions, and patients are followed every 2-4 weeks during the study. Patients are screened over 3 months prior to study entry."

 Combining two nucleoside drugs has the theoretical advantage of optimal protection against the evolution of resistant strains of HIV. However, one major problem with combination nucleoside therapy in patients with advanced disease is the increased toxicity resulting from such therapy. One approach to minimize toxicity while perhaps retaining some of the benefits of combination therapy is to alternate the two drugs.
 Patients are randomized to one of three treatment arms: AZT plus ddI, AZT plus ddC, and AZT alone alternating monthly with ddI. Half of the patients receiving AZT alternating monthly with ddI will start with AZT, while the other half will start with ddI. Treatment continues until death or termination of the study. Patients are followed every 4 weeks. The study will include a subset of patients for whom virologic, pharmacokinetic, and macroneurologic assessments will be made."

 Foscarnet is a drug that inhibits viruses and has been shown to be effective against infection with Cytomegalovirus and also against infection with the Herpes simplex virus in several patients with AIDS. Vidarabine has been shown to have activity against the Herpes simplex virus in patients who do not have AIDS, but it has not been studied in patients who do have AIDS. This study compares foscarnet and vidarabine treatments for AIDS patients who have herpes simplex infection that has not responded to therapy with acyclovir in the hope that one of these two drugs will help to stop further progression of the herpes simplex infection and may have fewer side effects.
 Following evaluation studies, patients receive at least 10 days of intravenous (IV) therapy with acyclovir. During this therapy, patients have two serum concentration levels of acyclovir drawn to make sure there are adequate levels of medication in their blood. If skin lesions do not heal after a total of 10 days of therapy with acyclovir, lesions are swabbed for viral culture to test the susceptibility of the virus to therapy with acyclovir, foscarnet, and vidarabine. If the test confirms that the herpes lesions are resistant to acyclovir, patients may choose to participate in the next phase of the study. Following additional evaluation studies, patients are randomized to one of two groups, each of which receives 10-21 days of IV treatment with one of the two alternative medications, foscarnet or vidarabine. Foscarnet is given by IV infusion every 8 hours, and each infusion lasts 1 hour.
 Vidarabine is given by IV infusion once a day, and each infusion lasts 12 hours. While receiving therapy with either foscarnet or vidarabine, blood tests are done every 3 days for routine lab tests and once a week to determine foscarnet or vidarabine blood levels. Skin lesions are cultured for herpes virus every 5 days. At the end of 10 days of therapy, improvement is evaluated, and the patients can continue to receive therapy if indicated.
 There is a provision for cross-over treatment if patients show a poor response."

 The vaccine Env 2-3 is created from one of the viral proteins that make up HIV called envelope glycoprotein gp120. A problem with many immunogens, including candidate HIV vaccines, is that they may evoke relatively weak immune responses, particularly in humans and in nonhuman primates. Thus, there is considerable interest in the development of adjuvants (substances that augment immune responses to vaccines). MTP-PE/MF59 is an adjuvant that appears to be particularly promising, and is selected for the studies with this HIV vaccine candidate.
 This study is being conducted in two parts: Part A examines the safety of the adjuvant
 MTP-PE/MF59 alone; Part B examines the safety and immunogenicity of Env 2-3 in combination with MTP-PE/MF59. In Part A, three volunteers receive MTP-PE/MF59, and one volunteer receives emulsion alone at each dose level. Initiation of each dose level is separated by at least 72 hours. Doses of adjuvant emulsion are administered at day 0 and day 30 for the highest tolerated dose. If significant reactions are encountered, additional subjects may be studied at lower doses. In Part B, six doses of MTP-PE adjuvant (0, 5, 10, 25, 50, or 100 mcg) in the
 MF59 emulsion are studied. Six volunteers receive Env 2-3/MTP-PE/MF59 and two receive
 MTP-PE/MF59 alone at each dose level. There is a minimum 1-week interval between dose escalations. Per amendment, volunteers may receive an additional dose of Env 2-3 or placebo in MF59 emulsion only, administered 12-18 months post initial inoculation."

 Of the methods that are being evaluated to treat HIV-infected individuals, AZT has produced the best results to date. Toxic effects in approximately 50 percent of patients receiving AZT may limit its usefulness for prolonged treatment. Long-term treatment may be necessary to prevent progression of early stage HIV infection to AIDS and to prevent secondary transmission. Other drugs that may be equally or more effective than AZT and useful in the long- term treatment of HIV infection must be developed and evaluated. Test-tube and animal studies of d4T show that the drug can inhibit replication (reproduction) of HIV at concentrations similar to concentrations of AZT that have anti-HIV activity. These studies also indicate that the drug may stay in the bloodstream longer than AZT. Thus, it may be possible for the drug to be as effective as AZT when taken less frequently than AZT. It also may have a less disturbing effect on other body functions (such as thymidine metabolism).
 Five patients are enrolled at each dose level and receive d4T for 10 weeks at their initial dose level. Escalation to the next higher dose level, using a different group of five patients, occurs after three patients in the preceding group have successfully completed at least 3 weeks of oral dosing."

 The profound immune impairment that results from HIV-1 infection is due, at least in part, to the loss of CD4+ T cells and the cytokines these cells secrete, especially IL-2 and interferon-gamma. Antiretroviral agents do not directly address the problem of immune impairment. Replacement of IL-2 at nontoxic doses may prevent or delay clinical immunosuppression and its attendant opportunistic infections. Also, since patients with HIV-1 infection respond suboptimally to routine protein and polysaccharide immunizations, IL-2 may provide an adjuvant effect on vaccine responses.
 Patients are randomized initially to receive their own antiretroviral therapy alone or in combination with IL-2 for 24 weeks, after which each group is crossed over to the other treatment assignment (i.e., IL-2 is either added or deleted from the regimen) for an additional 24 weeks.

 BACKGROUND:
 Cigarette smoking is recognized as the most important factor in the development of chronic airflow obstruction, yet only a minority of cigarette smokers develop clinical disease. In 1985, interest focused on the role of increased levels of airways responsiveness and atopy as possible potentiating factors for the development of chronic airflow obstruction. Then current epidemiologic studies had data on only one of these potential risk factors or were too small to adequately address the issues involved. The present study assesses both airways responsiveness and atopy.
 DESIGN NARRATIVE:
 The study used the population and data base of the Veterans Administration Normative Aging
 Study (NAS) which began in 1963. The NAS population consists of over 1,900 men originally selected for good health and their wives. The NAS currently administers a cigarette smoking history questionnaire, the NHLBI-ATS respiratory symptom and illness questionnaire, and spirometry at regularly scheduled examinations three years apart. The current study assessed airways responsiveness as measured by response to methacholine inhalation and atopy as measured by skin test, blood eosinophilia, and serum IgE in NAS participants when they returned for their next two examinations. The data were used to examine the relationship of airways responsiveness, atopy, and cigarette smoking to respiratory symptoms both cross-sectionally and longitudinally.
 The study was renewed in 1996 to prospectively identify factors that influence the rate of decline in pulmonary function and to identify predictors of chronic obstructive lung disease (COLD) and asthma in a population sample of older adults. The investigators hypothesize that the development of accelerated decline in FEV1 and the occurrence of respiratory symptoms in older adults are determined by two environmental exposures: tobacco smoke-induced injury and
 IgE-mediated hypersensitivity to inhaled aeroallergens. The extent to which allergen exposure and airway responsiveness lead to fixed airflow obstruction in older adults is unknown. The primary allergens of interest include: house dust mite (Der p I, Der fI), cockroach (Bla g I,
 Bla g II), cat (Fel d I), and fungi. Airway hyperresponsiveness to bronchoconstricting stimuli is a physiologic characteristic that may be thought of both as a manifestation of airway disease and as an intrinsic host characteristic which predisposes to the development of airway disease and determines its clinical pattern. They are using the extensive longitudinal information on respiratory symptoms and illnesses, cigarette smoking, pulmonary function, airway responsiveness, indices of atopy (skin test, total and antigen-specific
 IgE), indices of inflammation (eosinophil and leukocyte counts in peripheral blood), and allergen levels in dust and air in NAS participants and their wives to address the following hypotheses: that the association of increased airway responsiveness with accelerated longitudinal decline in pulmonary function is modified by gender, smoking, level of FEV1, and skin test reactivity;. that the level of exposure to common indoor allergens affects the rate of longitudinal decline of pulmonary function; that high levels of exposure to common indoor allergens leads to longitudinal increases in airway responsiveness over time; and that settled dust levels of fungi (culturable and countable organisms) and antigens, cockroach (Bla g l, Bla g II], and cat (Fel d I) are correlated with airborne levels of these agents.

 BACKGROUND:
 This longitudinal study was initiated in 1975 when a stratified random sample of children, ages 5-9 years and living in the East Boston area of the City of Boston, was selected. Annual lung function tests were performed on the children and their families and questionnaires administered on respiratory illness history, smoking history, disability from cardiac disease, age of menarche in female children and demographic data such as type of heating, type of fuel for cooking, types of air purifying devices, and area of residence. A subset of the cohort had repeated measures of eucapneic hyperventilation with cold air. The cohort was also studied with helium-oxygen protocol. Analysis focused on validation of existing models, including the autoregressive model, for lung growth in children and adolescents and the decline in growth in adults.
 DESIGN NARRATIVE:
 The longitudinal study was renewed in 1995. The overall aim of this continuing investigation was to evaluate risk factors heretofore determined to be important predictors of chronic respiratory symptoms, diagnosis of asthma, and alterations in expected levels of lung function in children and adolescents in a new population of young adult women. Within the existing population the investigators had already obtained repeated observations of airways responsiveness and measures of morbidity on a group of young adults aged up to 35. These data, however, were limited in total numbers to a few hundred. They expanded the observations to 883 women aged 17-22 specifically to assess risk factors that affected maximum attained level of lung function. Data on the entire cohort were collected cross-sectionally and included standardized questionnaires on respiratory symptoms, diseases, and exposures.
 Pulmonary function, height, and immediate medication history were subsequently obtained on the entire cohort, along with blood specimens that were analyzed immediately for WBC and total eosinophil counts and stored for subsequent analysis of lgE and cytokine profiles. To assess the impact of a history of asthma (wheeze), all subjects reporting asthma with the use of medication in the last month, a one-third sample of women with symptoms with no medication use, and an equal number of asymptomatic age and smoking matched women had spirometry repeated before and after bronchodilator use. The results of these investigations provided insights into risk factors affecting maximum obtained level of pulmonary function in women.
 Since level of function is a critical determinant of risk of developing chronic obstructive lung disease, the determination of the interaction of factors other than cigarette smoking led to better strategies for helping women to stop smoking, which would be a major step in reducing morbidity and mortality from chronic respiratory disease.
 The study was formerly supported by R01HL22528.

 The PaTH study is a 2-year, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to test the efficacy of combining hPTH (1-84) and alendronate for treating osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. 238 women were randomized between 55 and 85 years of age to receive either: (1) PTH for 1 year followed by alendronate for 1 year; (2) PTH and alendronate for 1 year followed by alendronate for 1 year; (3) alendronate for 2 years; or (4) PTH for 1 year followed by placebo for 1 year. The primary endpoints are changes in bone mineral density at several sites and changes in biochemical markers.
 In addition, we will assess specific biochemical markers of bone turnover (e.g., osteocalcin, deoxypridinoline, N-telopeptide, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase and bone sialoprotein) to determine if they can predict the skeletal response to combination therapy. We will also determine whether PTH positively affects ultrasound measurements in the calcaneus."

 BACKGROUND:
 In 1988, research suggested that high intake of saturated fat increased the risk of cardiovascular disease and cancer, and feeding polyunsaturated fatty acids decreased plasma lipid values. However, understanding of the roles of specific types of fatty acids in nutrition and health remained limited. This was primarily because the technology for analysis of fatty acid compositions in human tissue had only recently achieved the required specificities and secondarily because application of the technology on the large scale of an epidemiologic study had to await recent advances in automation of the chromatography. Also intervention studies, aimed at reducing dietary intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids for long periods of time, were either impractical or unethical. The study was conducted to confirm preliminary results suggesting greater prevalence of low levels of essential fatty acids, particularly w3 fatty acids, among people with cardiovascular disease and hypertension, and to provide further confirmatory evidence to results that hyperlipidemia was inversely associated with essential fatty acid levels.
 DESIGN NARRATIVE:
 Subjects were randomly selected from existing lists so that six men and six women were selected from each age-year group from 30 to 69 broken down as follows: ages 30-34; 35-39; 40-44; 45-49; 50-54; 55-59; 60-64; 65-69. Plasma samples for these subjects were retrieved from storage in batches and analyzed. The prevailing distribution of fatty acids in the general population was calculated. The interrelationships were studied among levels of fatty acids, particularly w3 and w6 fatty acids, with lipoproteins and apolipoproteins.
 Relationships among fatty acid compositions of different lipid fractions were explored and their relationship with various cardiovascular risk factors were evaluated. Over 60 fatty acids were quantitated using capillary gas-liquid chromatography. Tables of reference values were produced for the general population and for selected subpopulations. Multivariate analysis was used to correlate fatty acids and other biochemical markers.

 BACKGROUND:
 Cardiovascular abnormalities have been reported in Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) clinically, echocardiographically and at autopsy. Pericardial effusion, cardiac tamponade, echocardiographic abnormalities and clinical cardiomyopathy with right and left-sided congestive heart failure have all been reported as isolated case reports or in small retrospective series of patients with AIDS who had echocardiograms. The frequency with which abnormalities specifically related to AIDS were found in consecutively studied patients was not known in 1988 when the study began.
 The etiology of these abnormalities was also unclear. Since HIV infection resulted in profound suppression of T-cell macrophage-mediated immunity in AIDS and since there were significant abnormalities in B-cell lymphocyte function resulting in abnormalities of humoral immunity, there were frequently life threatening superinfections by bacterial, fungal, parasitic, and viral organisms. Some of these, such as herpes simplex, cytomegalovirus, cryptococcosis, toxoplasmosis and histoplasmosis, were known to cause pericarditis and myocarditis in the absence of AIDS so the presence of definite myocardial disease in AIDS did not prove that the disease was due to the HIV organism.
 Using echocardiography to study cardiac structure and function in a small series of patients with AIDS, abnormalities have been identified in from 25 to 75 percent of patients. All of these studies were retrospective; none was prospective with controls. Furthermore, all types of echocardiographic abnormalities have been described including the presence of pericardial fluid, mitral valve prolapse, chamber size abnormalities, and wall motion abnormalities.
 Although these abnormalities could have been due to infection with the HIV organism there were many other possible reasons for the echocardiographic abnormalities. Among AIDS patients there was a high incidence of intravenous drug and alcohol abuse, patients in whom cardiac abnormalities were common.
 Since there were no echocardiographic studies comparing HIV antibody- positive groups of patients to appropriate controls, it was not known whether the high reported incidence of echocardiographic abnormalities was related specifically to the HIV infection, to superinfection with other organisms, or was related to factors other than AIDS.
 This project was part of an Institute-initiated study on AIDS-Associated Heart Disease in
 Adults. In September 1987 the concept was approved by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood
 Advisory Council and a Request for Applications was released. Awards were made in July 1988.
 DESIGN NARRATIVE:
 Patients were recruited from the in-patient out-patient clinics and wards of the San
 Francisco General Hospital and the Moffitt-Long Hospitals. A medical history was obtained and a physical examination conducted which included an electrocardiogram, chest x-rays and
 Doppler echocardiogram. All studies were repeated every four months for four years in
 HIV-positive groups. If clinical evidence of cardiac disease appeared, all studies including chest x-ray were repeated at that time. If there was normal systolic function in patients with definite left ventricular failure, a radionuclide angiogram was obtained to further evaluate left ventricular diastolic function.

 BACKGROUND:
 In 1988, the leading cause of death in AIDS patients was respiratory mechanisms might have played a significant role in its pathogenesis.
 The project was part of an Institute-initiated study on AIDS-Associated Heart Disease in
 Adults. The concept was approved by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Advisory Council in
 September 1987. The Request for Applications was also released in September 1987. Awards were made in July 1988.
 DESIGN NARRATIVE:
 The prevalence study was one of three subprojects with the common failure due to chronic opportunistic pulmonary infection, primarily Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. Drugs such as azidothymidine (AZT) and trimetrexate showed some effectiveness in prolonging the lives of some AIDS patients. With increased survival, it was believed that cardiac diseases might well become an important complication of AIDs. Reports described a syndrome of rapidly progressive cardiomyopathy associated with AIDS. The etiology of AIDS-associated cardiomyopathy was yet unknown although immunologic theme of the immunopathogenesis of AIDS-associated cardiomyopathy. The other two subprojects dealt with immunopathology studies in endomyocardial biopsies and autopsy tissues and serologic studies. The AIDS Clinical Research
 Center at Johns Hopkins Hospital served as the source of patients. All patients underwent serologic testing and echocardiography at time of entry and at six and twelve months. The screening electrocardiogram identified 40 to 50 patients per year with AIDS-associated cardiomyopathy. Approximately 30 patients per year had no contraindications for endomyocardial biopsy. Comprehensive tissue studies and cellular immune studies were performed on the cohort and autopsies, if possible. Immunohistochemical techniques and in situ hybridization of biopsy and autopsy material were used to determine if AIDS-associated cardiomyopathy was associated with HIV infection of the heart or with some other viral or opportunistic non-viral infection. Indirect immunofluorescence and a Western immunoblotting assay using patient sera determined the prevalence of heart autoimmunity.

 BACKGROUND:
 Current government physical fitness guidelines state that: 1) the majority of the health benefits from physical activity can be obtained by walking two miles briskly on most days of the week; and 2) the health benefits of physical activity depend principally on the total amount of activity rather than the intensity of the activity. Nevertheless, there are currently no prospective epidemiological studies extant, designed specifically to directly contrast the health benefits and costs of moderate exercise (e.g., walking) versus vigorous exercise (e.g., running).
 DESIGN NARRATIVE:
 Before the start of the study, 233,000 person-years of follow-up had been accumulated in 56,000 runners (between 1991 and 1997). The runners were resurveyed in 1997 along with 68,000 walkers. The walkers were also solicited through the publication of the questionnaire in
 Walking magazine followed by a direct mailing of the questionnaire to 425,000 subscribers.
 Total and cause-specific mortality will be determined from the National Death Index; fatal and nonfatal cancers will be identified from the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance,
 Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) and 46 state registries; nonfatal coronary heart disease and injuries will be determined from questionnaires. Survival analyses will be used to test whether runners have greater reduction in heart disease, total mortality, and cancer per unit of exercise. Exercise-related injuries from walking and running will also be examined. Power calculations suggest that detection of differences between runners and walkers, as small as 11% for total mortality, 16% for CHD, 12% for total cancers, and 36% for breast cancer, will be possible. The differences will be adjusted for weekly kilocalories expended by walking and running, for walking and running distance, and for time spent on each activity to test whether these variables account for differences in disease rates between walkers and runners.
 By the end of the study, 517,000 person years in 68,000 runners (between 1991 and 2001) will be available for analysis. Survival analysis will be used to test for a dose-response relationship between running mileage and CHD and cancer risk, and whether this relationship is affected by running intensity, running frequency, running history, gender, adiposity, age or medication use. Using conservative rates (25% below published values), statistical power calculations suggest that detectable reduction in coronary heart disease risk as small as 0.71% per mile will be possible, which is far below the estimated reduction from other published studies (2.1%). Additionally, a detectable reduction in breast cancer risk as small as 1.5% per mile run in women is calculated, which is below the 1.7% reduction in risk estimated from other published data.

 BACKGROUND:
 The investigators hypothesized that increased platelet activation and coronary artery vasoconstriction exist in African Americans, due to greater vascular endothelial dysfunction, heightened adrenergic drive, and greater vascular reactivity, resulting in excess sudden death and the occurrence of myocardial infarction in people with less severe angiographic coronary disease.
 The study was one of eight grants awarded as part of the Request for Applications Mechanisms
 Underlying Coronary Heart Disease in Blacks. The initiative was released in October 1991 and awarded in September 1992.
 DESIGN NARRATIVE:
 Previous studies had demonstrated high prevalences of coronary disease risk factors and occult coronary disease in this sibling population. Subjects were recruited to come for a one day screening, with measurement of coronary disease risk factors (blood pressure, smoking, lipid profile, apolipoproteins B and A1, lipoprotein(a), blood glucose, insulin, and fibrinogen), and a maximal treadmill test with tomographic thallium imaging to identify occult coronary disease. Platelet function was assessed by spontaneous in-vitro aggregation, activated IIa/IIIb receptor density, and serum thromboxane B2 concentration. Factors contributing to sudden cardiac death were assessed by an echocardiogram for left ventricular mass, electrocardiogram (ECG) for QRS late potentials, and 24 hour ECG monitoring for ventricular arrhythmias, episodes of silent ischemia, and heart rate variability (to assess adrenergic drive). Vascular reactivity was characterized by heart rate and blood pressure changes during Stroop color card and cold pressor testing. Siblings with an abnormal exercise
 ECG and/or thallium scan were offered coronary arteriography to assess the severity of angiographic coronary disease and the vasomotor responses to isometric handgrip and intracoronary acetylcholine, an endothelium-dependent vasodilator. In coronary arteries with minimal angiographic disease, changes in coronary vascular resistance during handgrip and acetylcholine were also measured with a doppler flow velocity catheter and the proximal arteries were imaged with intravascular ultrasound.

 BACKGROUND:
 The integrating theme of the study is that hostility affects both behaviors and biologic functions in ways that increase the risks of developing coronary atherosclerosis or suffering an acute CHD event. Disciplines involved include psychology, internal medicine, cardiology, psychiatry, pharmacology, biostatistics, epidemiology, and molecular biology.
 DESIGN NARRATIVE:
 There were five subprojects in the original program project grant. Subproject 1 examined the social, behavioral and biologic concommitants of both natural and experimental interpersonal conflicts as a function of multimodal hostility assessments. Subproject 2 examined the role of hostility and social support in survival among CHD patients and attempted to identify the behavioral mediators of survival effects. Subproject 4 evaluated the effects of hostility, both alone and jointly with risk factors and social factors, on CHD incidence in over 5,000 participants in the University of North Carolina Alumni Heart Study. Subproject 5 evaluated the effects of age, smoking, lipids, and adrenergic receptors on physiologic reactivity of hostile and nonhostile men to anger induced by interpersonal challenges in the lab as well as the events of daily life. Subproject 7 extended the evaluation of anger-associated biologic reactivity in hostile and nonhostile persons by studying biobehavioral responses of 200 women employed in a real world high stress work situation; it also evaluated the impact of a stress management intervention designed to reduce anger on biobehavioral reactivity in these same employees.
 The study was renewed in fiscal year (FY) 1997 to expand the primary focus on hostility to include a set of psychosocial, behavioral, and biological characteristics that increased coronary heart disease risk and appeared to cluster in certain individuals and groups, especially those low in socioeconomic status (SES). Subproject 1 examined in approximately 360 subjects the synergistic effects of SES and psychosocial risk factors such as depression, hostility, and social isolation on biological and behavioral factors suspected or known to contribute to atherogenesis. Subproject 2 evaluated the role of the central nervous system serotonin function as a potential mediator of the clustering of health-damaging psychosocial and biobehavioral characteristics in the same individuals and low SES groups. Subproject 3, the Psychosocial Risk for Cardiovascular Disease in Youth Project (PRCVDYP), used three ongoing general population studies of youth as a basis for examining the development of psychosocial risk for cardiovascular disease. The investigators hypothesized that low SES youth would exhibit, in addition to increased levels of the psychosocial and behavioral risk factors under study, increased sympathetic nervous system tone and reactivity to mental challenge, as well as decreased peripheral nervous system tone. They also hypothesized that depression, social isolation, and harsh parenting will interact with low SES to increase cardiovascular disease risk. Subproject 4 used a rat model to investigate early experience, serotonin and adult function.
 The study was renewed in FY 2004 and includes three subprojects. Subproject 1 will determine the role of gene-environment interactions in the expression of psychosocial and biobehavioral risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Variants will be identified in candidate genes and chromosomal loci that are associated with the endophenotypes of hostility, personality, other psychosocial risk factors, health behaviors, and the following responses to rest and stress
 -- cardiovascular and neuroendocrine function, platelet activation and serotonin transporter function, circulatory inflammatory markers and the tendency of all of these characteristics to cluster in the same individuals and low socioeconomic groups. A total of 400 probands (half African American, half Caucasian, half women) and at least one sibling for each proband will be recruited for a total of 800 to 1200 subjects. Subproject 2 will explore in 400 subjects the genetics of glucose metabolism, hostility, and cardiovascular disease risk factors. Subproject 3 will examine the genetics, hostility and biology of stress in daily life in 400 probands and one sibling for every proband."
NCT00026754,383683,2018-10-25T00:00:00Z,Clinical Trial Description,383683,AACT,"
 Background:
 -  Patients and healthy volenteers who are being evaluated for NIH Intramural Research
 Program (IRP) protocols must be screened to determine whether they meet the eligibility criteria prior to enrollment.
 -  Performing invasive procedures for the sole purpose of obtaining tissue specimens or biological fluids for research purposes is often not ethically justifiable in human subjects, yet these specimens are needed to advance our knowledge on a variety of cancers. Therefore, it is critical to obtain tissue and biological fluid samples for future research when procedures (e.g., surgical excision, diagnostic biopsy) are performed for clinical indications in this population. Invasive procedures will not be performed on healthy volunteers.
 Objectives:
 -  Evaluate patient or healthy volunteer eligibility for participation in NIH IRP research protocols.
 -  Collect results of screening test for use on subsequent research protocols as baseline ( e.g., pretreatment) values.
 -  Collect specific research samples required for the primary research protocol as part of a screening test or procedure in order to avoid from having to subject the patient to a painful procedure on multiple occasions.
 -  Procure residual tissues or fluids that are remaining from tests or procedures that are performed for clinical indications (e.g., diagnosis or treatment of the cancer) during the screening process or during treatment and follow-up on a primary research protocol.
 These specimens will be stored for future research studies.
 Eligibility:
 - Patients and healthy volunteers who are being evaluated for and treated on protocols within the NIH IRP.
 Design:
 -  This protocol is not a research study
 -  Screening tests and procedures that are required by the primary research protocols are conducted in order to establish eligibility for these protocols.
 -  In some cases specific research samples required for the primary research protocol may be collected during the screening process in order to avoid from having to subject the patient to a painful procedure on multiple occasions.
 -  Tissues and biological fluids that are obtained during or after the screening process or at any time during treatment and follow-up on a primary NIH IRP research protocol will be stored. Residual biological fluids will be obtained during tests or procedures that are considered clinically indicated for the diagnosis or treatment of the patient's cancer or related disease.
 -  Once a patient or healthy volunteer completes the screening process and is either enrolled onto another NIH study or is returned to the care of their local physician they will be taken off study."

 Background:
 -  This protocol acknowledges that it is in the interest of the NIH and ROB, as well as our patients, to continue to follow those who have been treated with radiotherapy at ROB and are not otherwise eligible for current active research protocols.
 -  It also provides a mechanism for the correlation and interpretation of disparate data for research into the long term side effects and outcomes for a variety of disease entities and treatments, such as combined modality treatment, MoAb, PDT, radiation modifiers, intraoperative radiotherapy, etc.
 Objectives:
 -The objective of this protocol is to provide follow-up care for patients previously treated with radiotherapy in the Radiation Oncology Branch (ROB) in order to assess the late effects of treatment and the natural history of disease.
 Eligibility:
 -Patients who received radiation therapy at the NCI IRB who are long-term survivors and are not currently entered on an active research protocol.
 Design:
 -  This is a natural history protocol that will provide follow-up care for Radiation
 Oncology Branch patients and will allow for appropriate long-term follow up care and evaluation, including NIH consultation services as required.
 -  It will be made clear to patients in the consent form, that data collected in their follow-up may be used anonymously for publications concerning the natural history of disease processes and long-term effects of treatment."

 Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) results from autoimmune destruction of the insulin-producing pancreatic beta-cells. The onset of clinical symptoms represents the endpoint of a chronic progressive decline in beta-cell function when the number of functional beta-cells descends below the critical mass required for maintenance of euglycemia ([1], [2]). However, the pancreas still retains the ability to produce a substantial amount of insulin. The goal of secondary prevention in T1DM is to avert further destruction of the remaining beta-cells and therefore delay or stop entry into the final stages of the disease associated with end organ damage.
 The rationale for this study is to interfere with the autoimmune beta-cell destruction early on in order to preserve as much residual endogenous insulin production as possible. We plan to administer oral interferon-alpha (IFN-a) on a daily basis, which has been shown to modify the clinical course of diabetes, to alter cytokine release, and reduce expression of T cell activation markers in an animal model ([3]) and a pilot project in humans (S. Brod,
 University of Texas, unpublished data). The one-year study is designed as a double blind randomized protocol using either 5,000 or 30,000 units of IFN-a versus placebo. Five centers will participate in this protocol (University of Texas Health Science Center in Houston;
 Dallas; Children's Hospital, St. Paul, MN; Kansas City and NIH, Bethesda, Maryland)."

 It is proposed a randomized, blinded, controlled trial comparing vestibular rehabilitation (VR) to Tai Chi (TC). Our overall goal is to explore whether, and if so, how TC can improve functional, dynamic stability in persons with vestibulopathy (VSP). It is hypothesized that the TC group will demonstrate significantly greater improvement in performing functional activities than the VR group.
 Sixty subjects will be randomly assigned into either TC instruction or VR. Both treatment groups will receive identical duration treatment once a week for 10 weeks, with supplemental home exercises. It is hypothesized that 1) TC improves whole-body dynamic locomotor stability more than does VR; 2) TC improves gait coordination during planned and unplanned obstacle encounters more than does VR; 3) TC improves whole-body speed related movement control more than does VR."

 A general characteristic of the motor system is that people can perform some learned movements automatically. The underlying neural correlates of automatic movement have been investigated, but are not fully understood. In the present study, in order to investigate the brain activities contributing to the phenomenon, we use a specially designed dual task paradigm and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) technique. Forty healthy adult subjects are asked to perform motor tasks (squeezing of hand or sequential movement of fingers) while listening to an auditory distraction task, or to execute two different motor tasks simultaneously. fMRI is obtained during their performance of these tasks. By analyzing fMRI results, we will explore the brain regions especially devoted to the automatic movements."

 BACKGROUND:
 The study should improve knowledge of the patterns of functional lung development during childhood and factors that influence both relative level and growth rate of lung function in
 Black children and should offer new understanding of the predictive value of spirometric tests of lung function performed at an early age.
 DESIGN NARRATIVE:
 The study used a previously existing database which was of unique value because it included comprehensive respiratory illness data collected on-site during the children's tenure in the
 Frank Porter Graham Child Development Center's daycare facility and spirometric data collected longitudinally from three to 13 years of age. Furthermore, the measurements were for children in a racial group for whom limited cross-sectional or longitudinal spirometric data were available.
 The longitudinal analyses had two primary objectives. The first was to characterize patterns of functional lung development in Black children from three to 13 years of age and relate these patterns to potentially influential factors such as (a) wheezing and non-wheezing associated LRI experience during the infant (ages 0 to two) and preschool (ages two to five) years, (b) ages of occurrence of first and subsequent LRI episodes, and (c) respiratory syncytial virus etiology of LRI. Potentially confounding factors included prenatal and childhood exposure to environmental tobacco smoke and allergies. The second objective was to determine the degree to which spirometric parameters 'track' for individual children and for populations of children over the interval from three to 13 years of age. This objective required assessment of the degree to which spirometric evaluations during the preschool years were predictive of later lung function.
 The statistical analyses for achieving these objectives used recently developed statistical methods based on the general linear mixed model. By design, these methods for longitudinal data handled unbalanced data with missing values, incorporated time-varying covariates, and provided more exactly the extent to which the level of lung function of individual children was maintained relative to that of other study children and determined the value of preschool spirometric measurements as predictors of levels of spirometric performance during later childhood and adolescence. These analyses utilized methods developed by Stewart, Pekow,
 Burchinal, and Helms in 1991 that were unique in that they were designed to handle incomplete, inconsistently-timed data as well as complete, balanced data.

 Obesity is a major predisposing factor for future Type 2 diabetes because it is often associated with insulin resistance and impaired glucose tolerance. Insulin resistance has been suggested as the common link for other aspects of the cardiac dysmetabolic syndrome that includes hypertension, dyslipidemia, obesity, and macrovascular arterial disease. There are racial disparities in the prevalence of both obesity and Type 2 diabetes: Compared with non-Hispanic Caucasians, African American women have almost twice the prevalence of overweight, obesity, and Type 2 diabetes.
 Because data from predominantly Caucasian populations suggest that the quantity of truncal (sometimes called upper body) adipose tissue, which includes the adipose tissue surrounding the abdominal viscera, is far more important for risk stratification than that found in the limbs or buttocks, which contain subcutaneous adipose tissue, it has been presumed that attempts at treatment of obesity should concentrate on reducing visceral fat. However, despite their greater risks for the complications of obesity, African Americans have less visceral abdominal adipose tissue than Caucasians matched for body weight. Further, recent metabolic studies suggest that upper body subcutaneous adipose tissue may play a significant role, particularly for African Americans, in the comorbid metabolic conditions associated with obesity.
 With the advent of the large volume liposuction technique, selective removal of substantial quantities of subcutaneous adipose tissue has become possible. It is unknown whether the complications of obesity can be ameliorated by removal of subcutaneous adipose tissue, but one preliminary study suggests that fasting hyperinsulinism can be improved by this approach.
 We propose to conduct a pilot study of 10 patients (five Caucasians and five
 African-Americans) who plan to undergo liposuction. We will investigate how large volume liposuction affects the metabolic complications of obesity in overweight patients who have hyperinsulinemia, impaired glucose tolerance, or type 2 diabetes. We will investigate the effects of liposuction on various indices of the cardiac dysmetabolic syndrome by performing studies of insulin sensitivity and lipid metabolism at four time points: before large volume liposuction, 1 month after liposuction, 4 months after liposuction, and 1 year after liposuction. At each visit we will study body composition, blood pressure, cardiac function, dietary habits, insulin insensitivity, free fatty acids, and lipid profiles."

 BACKGROUND:
 In 1990, the available data on medication adherence among chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients consistently indicated that adherence was a significant problem. This was a particularly distressing finding, considering that pharmacological therapy was considered the backbone of COPD management in settings where comprehensive rehabilitation services were limited. Despite the importance of this issue and a large data base on how to enhance medication adherence among medical populations, there had been no empirical investigations evaluating the implementation of these strategies with COPD patients.
 DESIGN NARRATIVE:
 The prospective, controlled study randomized 230 emphysema and chronic bronchitis patients from an urban university medical center into either a usual care, control group or into a self-management skills training program for improving adherence. The training program was based on self-management procedures for enhancing adherence which had proven efficacious with diverse populations.
 Self-reported and objective measures of adherence were examined during the two month baseline period and the one year follow-up in the controlled study. A range of possible covariates including demographics, patient characteristics, treatment, and therapeutic outcome variables were also collected during the baseline phase and at the 6-month and 12-month follow-up visits in the controlled study to evaluate their relationship to the observed adherence levels.

 BACKGROUND:
 Asthma, a disease characterized by increased airway reactivity and inflammation in response to a variety of stimuli, is emerging as the most prevalent and serious environmental health problem among children in the United States. Numerous studies, both prospective and cross-sectional, suggest that exposure to ETS is one of the predominate risk factors for childhood asthma, but this has not been confirmed in a controlled trial.
 DESIGN NARRATIVE:
 The randomized, double-blind prospective trial involving 225 children with doctor-diagnosed asthma who are exposed to environmental tobacco smoke tests the efficacy of reducing such exposure on unscheduled asthma visits and asthma symptoms. The intervention consists of placement of 2 high efficiency air filtration with activated carbon, potassium permanganate and zeolite filter insert to reduce exposure to ETS in the experimental homes and inactive (placebo) units in the control group homes. The following hypotheses are tested. (1.0)
 Children assigned to the ETS reduction group will have a greater than 20 percent reduction in unscheduled asthma visits during one-year follow-up compared with those in the control group. (1.1) Children assigned to the ETS reduction group will have significant improvements in asthma symptoms compared with children in the control group. (1.2) Children assigned to the
 ETS reduction group will have greater than 10 percent reduction in ETS exposure and exhaled nitric oxide, a measure of airway inflammation during one year of follow-up compared with the control group."

 BACKGROUND:
 Type 2 diabetes mellitus, which is becoming more prevalent in our society as the population ages, is one of the strongest risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD) and consequent mortality. In addition to generating an enormous toll in human suffering, diabetes places an economic burden approaching 100 billion dollars annually on the U.S. health care system.
 Despite the well known dismal prognosis of diabetes complicated by angiographically documented CAD, the optimal treatment paradigm for this large group of patients has not been studied. Coronary revascularization, while increasingly used, has not been directly shown to be of additional benefit to simultaneous intensive medical management of CAD along with management of hyperglycemia, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and other risk factors. Moreover, while intensive efforts to lower HbA1c have been demonstrated to favorably affect the clinical course of Type 2 diabetes mellitus in terms of microvascular complications, the optimal hyperglycemia management strategy with regard to macrovascular outcome is not known.
 These critical treatment dilemmas have motivated the development of BARI 2D, a multicenter randomized trial designed to determine in patients with Type 2 diabetes and stable CAD: 1) the efficacy of initial elective coronary revascularization combined with aggressive medical therapy, compared to an initial strategy of aggressive medical therapy alone; and 2) the efficacy of a strategy of providing more insulin (endogenous or exogenous), versus a strategy of increasing sensitivity to insulin (reducing insulin resistance), in the management of hyperglycemia, with a target HbA1c level of less than 7.0% for each strategy.
 DESIGN NARRATIVE:
 The BARI 2D trial is a multicenter study that uses a 2x2 factorial design, with 2400 patients being assigned at random to initial elective revascularization with aggressive medical therapy or aggressive medical therapy alone with equal probability, and simultaneously being assigned at random to an insulin providing or insulin sensitizing strategy of glycemic control (with a target value for HbA1c of less than 7.0% for all patients). Following confirmation of patient eligibility and provision of written consent, patients were randomized as shown below:

 The prevalence, risk factors and significance of oral manifestations in aplastic anemia have not been well characterized. Thus, in the present study, through a retrospective chart review, we document the prevalence of oral complications in AA patients and the risks for oral manifestations in a case-control study. Schizophrenic patients represent controls.
 Information includes the following; demographic, clinical and radiographic information for cases and controls.

 Background:
 Kaposi s sarcoma (KS) is caused by a gammaherpesvirus called Kaposi s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), or human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8). However, infection with KSHV is not sufficient to cause KS, and HIV infection is an important cofactor. Treatment of HIV with potent antiretroviral therapy can reduce the risk of KS, and can also induce regression in patients with established HIV-KS. One mechanism by which HIV is believed to contribute to KS is through HIV-induced immunodeficiency which leads to a loss of immunologic control of KSHV and/or KS itself. However, other mechanisms may also contribute.
 Objectives:
 One primary objective is to assess the effects of the initiation of potent anti-HIV therapy on specific factors possibly linked to the control or pathogenesis of KS, namely serum viral
 IL-6 and plasma VEGF levels, in patients with KS or at risk for KS by virtue of being infected with KSHV/HHV-8. Another is to assess the effects of anti-HIV therapy on KSHV infection. Secondary objectives are to assess the effects of potent antiretroviral therapy on established KS and other factors related to KS or KSHV infection.
 Eligibility:
 The principal eligibility factors are age 13 or above, HIV infection, and either KS or infection with KSHV. Exclusion factors include KS that requires specific therapy, recent corticosteroid therapy, recent cytokine therapy, or opportunistic infections requiring therapy.
 Design:
 Patients will be treated with potent antiretroviral therapy. For patients with established
 KS, the effects of the therapy on the KS will be monitored. In addition, a variety of factors related to KS, HIV infection, therapy, or KSHV infection will be monitored. These include the
 HIV viral load, KSHV secretion in saliva, the CD4 count, serum VEGF levels, and serum IL-6 levels."

 The prime objective of this Innovative Stage I A/B Behavioral Therapy Development Research project is to conduct a pilot study under randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled conditions, to provide preliminary estimation of the efficacy of a 6 week Accu Drop nicotine fading protocol used in conjunction with cigarette tapering to bring about termination of cigarette usage in moderate to heavy smokers (*15 cpd) who are interested in smoking cessation. Both the experimental and control groups in this study will receive six weeks of the manually driven behavioral treatment by experienced and trained therapists. The experimental group (N=30) will also be prescribed active Accu Drops (AD&C) while the control condition (N=30) will be prescribed placebo Accu Drops (PD&C) very similar in appearance, viscosity, and taste to active Accu Drops. Completion of the study protocol and smoking cessation rates at 1 week, 1 month, and 6 months post-treatment will be the prime measures of efficacy. The findings of this study will provide sufficient preliminary indication for the efficacy of the experimental treatment and its extended investigation in a Phase II study or for its nonefficacy."

 The Hyper IgE Syndromes (HIES) are primary immunodeficiencies resulting in eczema and recurrent skin and lung infections. Autosomal dominant Hyper IgE syndrome (AD-HIES; Job's syndrome) is caused by STAT3 mutations, and is a multisystem disorder with skeletal, vascular, and connective tissue manifestations. Understanding how STAT3 mutations cause these diverse clinical manifestations is critical to our complete understanding of bone metabolism, bronchiectasis, dental maturation, and atherosclerosis. Mutations in DOCK8 cause many cases of autosomalrecessive Hyper IgE syndrome. These individuals suffer from extensive viral infections as well as have a high incidence of malignancy and mortality. The pathogenesis of this disease is being investigated. Therefore, we seek to enroll patients and families with a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of HIES syndrome for extensive phenotypic and genotypic study as well as disease management. Patients will be carefully examined by a multidisciplinary team and followed longitudinally. Through these studies we hope to better characterize the clinical presentation of HIES and to be able to identify further genetic etiologies, as well as understand the pathogenesis of HIES. We seek to enroll 300 patients and 300 relatives."

 The administration of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) leads to splenic enlargement in approximately one third of neutropenic patients who are chronically treated with this drug. Short courses, 5 to 6-days, of G-CSF are used to increase the yield of hematopoietic progenitor cells collected by apheresis from peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) donors. G-CSF mobilized PBSC concentrates are increasingly replacing marrow as a source of hematopoietic progenitor cells for transplants involving HLA-compatible relatives. PBSC donors experience splenomegaly and rarely, spontaneous rupture of the spleen. Since splenomegaly is a risk factor for splenic rupture, it is important to determine the incidence and time course of splenic enlargement in PBSC concentrate donors. This protocol will prospectively study 40 subjects donating G-CSF mobilized PBSC for HLA compatible relatives or donating PBSC's for laboratory investigations at the Department of Transfusion Medicine in the Warren G. Magnuson Clinical Center. The subjects will be given G-CSF for 5 days and a
 PBSC concentrate will be collected on day 5. Ultrasound scans will be used to assess their spleen size. The scans will be performed before G-CSF administration and the day the last
 PBSC concentrate is collected. A third scan will be performed 10 or 11 days after the last
 PBSC is collected. The effects of several parameters on spleen size will be assessed including: donor age, gender, race and changes in liver function assays, white blood cell counts, platelet counts, and CD34+ cell counts."

 The adrenal glands are the major source in the body of the steroid hormones. In normal physiology, the pituitary hormone ACTH regulates the secretion of glucocorticoids, while the secretion of mineralocorticoids such as aldosterone is controlled by the renin-angiotensin system. In addition to these two classes of steroids, the adrenal gland secretes lesser amounts of intermediate metabolites as well as dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and its sulfated product (DHEAS) and androstenedione, testosterone, estrogen, and estrone. Dysregulated secretion of any of these hormones can be caused by sporadic adrenocortical adenomas or carcinomas, with the development of specific clinical syndromes depending on the identity of the hormones secreted. In at least a subset of cortisol-producing adrenocortical neoplasms, the presence of ectopic or abnormal receptors has been described, resulting in the regulation of cortisol and/or aldosterone by non-physiologic stimuli. The present study will serve as a mechanism to investigate individuals with steroid hormone-secreting adrenocortical tumors of all types for the purpose of identifying hereditary, congenital, or acquired defects leading not only to hormone oversecretion, but also to tumor formation. One of the first goals of the study was (until very recently) to examine the prevalence of ectopic receptor expression in cortisol- and/or aldosterone- hormone secreting adrenocortical tumors. This led to the understanding of the ontogeny of these tumors and the development of novel therapeutic strategies (e.g., receptor antagonists) to control hormone oversecretion. We currently use this information for the evaluation and treatment of our patients. An important research goal of the study is to identify novel genetic defects leading to tumors of the adrenal gland.
 This is done through a set of methods, from sequencing of the collected DNA to analysis of the expression of large sets of genes using gene array/gene chip analysis. This information may help to identify patients who would benefit from more aggressive intervention strategies, especially those with potentially malignant tumors. This study also provides the patient cohort necessary for the establishment of a bank of tissues of varying tumors of the adrenal cortex, which may serve in the future as an experimental resource to test new diagnostic and therapeutic methods. Finally, an important and more recent goal of this study is to investigate the effects of excess aldosterone on renal, cardiac, metabolic, and bone systems in patients with primary hyperaldosteronism, an important subgroup of patients with adrenocortical tumors. Patients with hyperaldosetronism have not been studied with the same rigor as patients with hypercortisolism in the past; this study aims at investigating the relative contribution of hyperaldosteronism in the etiopathogenesis of a number of clinical problems in patients with adrenocortical lesions and hypertension."

 Background:
 Renal cell cancer responds to treatment with a variety of antiangiogenic and immunomodulatory drugs.
 In the RENCA model of renal cell cancer the combination of IL-12 and pulse IL-2 cures 88-100% of mice with established tumors.
 The tumor regression observed in this model is due to both antiangiogenic and immunologic effects.

 To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of intravenous rhIL-12/pulse rhIL-2 administration in adults with various advanced and/or refractory solid tumors.
 To provide a preliminary assessment of the ability of rhIL-12/pulse rhIL-2 to modify neovascularization and gene expression in the local tumor site, and to induce a measurable antitumor effect in adults with various advanced and/or refractory solid tumors.
 To evaluate the immunomodulatory activity of combined systemic administration of rhIL-12/pulse rhIL-2.
 Eligibility:
 Patients with advanced solid tumors for whom a proven more effective therapy does not exist.
 Patients with renal cell cancer will be required to have received sunitinib or sorefinib or refused this option.

 The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and toxicity of an alternative steroid dosing regimen for patients with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), using a pilot study design that will enroll 20 patients. Although the literature reports variable steroid responsiveness, remission rates of up to 30-40 percent have recently been reported in nephrotic adult patients treated with daily prednisone at 1 mg/kg/day for at least 4 months, followed by a taper over 3-4 months. Such a prolonged and aggressive steroid course is fraught with significant morbidity, but this approach has been advocated by some authors because of the poor prognosis for renal survival in nephrotic patients with FSGS who do not achieve remission with steroid treatment. We plan to test an eight month course of high dose steroid therapy administered in monthly pulses instead of daily doses, for comparable efficacy in achieving remission, and for the occurrence of adverse steroid side effects. We plan to enroll patients with nephrotic syndrome due to biopsy-proven FSGS, who have either not been treated, or have responded to conventional steroid dosing regimens and relapsed. We plan to treat them with monthly oral pulses of dexamethasone (40-60 mg/d x 4 days), for 8 months. The primary endpoint will be induction of complete remission, defined as urine protein less than 300 mg/d. Patients will also be evaluated for manifestations of steroid toxicity. Patients will be seen in follow up at intervals up to 24 months following study entry. If this study suggests that remission of nephrotic syndrome can be attained with this regimen, and with an acceptable toxicity profile, we will plan a randomized controlled trial of this regimen compared with daily or alternate day oral steroids."

 BACKGROUND:
 The current National Longitudinal Mortality Study began in 1983 with agreements with the
 Census Bureau which prepared baseline files from surveys representative of the United States and with the National Center for Health Statistics which prepared the National Death Index identifying deaths in the baseline populations. The baseline population of over one million persons has been matched to the NDI on several occasions, resulting in approximately 100,000 deaths occurring in 1979 to 1989. Using available data, an analysis was conducted relating socio-economic characteristics to subsequent mortality.
 DESIGN NARRATIVE:
 The NLMS is a national study of mortality over time among selected Census Bureau population samples numbering about 2.4 million. The census samples are matched to the National Death
 Index (NDI) maintained by the National Center for Health Statistics. The NDI is a file of all
 U.S. deaths since 1979 and is used to determine which individuals in the Current Population
 Surveys (CPS) have died. The samples are matched every other year to obtain deaths among these cohorts. Death certificates are then purchased from the states and coded for causes of death and other data. Mortality rates by age, sex, race, national origin, occupation, industry, income, education, state of residence and other factors are then obtained. The follow-up period begins with 1979, the first year covered by the NDI and ends with 1998. The total number of deaths for these cohorts is estimated to be about 250,000.
 Census samples in the NLMS are being matched to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) medicare database. Hospitalization, physician, outpatient, and other CMS data will be incorporated into the NLMS database for all participants meeting the Medicare age eligibility criteria. The study continues through December, 2009."
NCT00005158,385783,2018-10-25T00:00:00Z,Clinical Trial Description,385783,AACT,"
 BACKGROUND:
 There are two general hypotheses about the nature of the genetic component of hypertension. A single gene hypothesis visualizes hypertension as a specific disease entity determined by an autosomal dominant or incompletely dominant allele with little environmental effect. A polygenic hypothesis views hypertension as determined by a large number of genetic and environmental factors operating independently with roughly equal contributions. The evidence supporting the single gene hypothesis is based primarily on bimodal and trimodal distributions of blood pressure in the population. It has been suggested that the bimodal or trimodal distributions are the result of ascertainment bias. The evidence supporting the polygenic model is based on several studies where the distribution of blood pressure is unimodal and often skewed toward higher values in both the population and in first degree relatives of hypertensive individuals. These skewed distributions can be approximately normalized using log transformations.
 In this study, a particular effort was made to detect major genes. A major gene is said to exist in a particular sample if an appreciable amount of the variability of a trait in that sample is due to segregation of alleles at a single locus. The presence of a major gene does not preclude the existence of other genetic or environmental effects. In the last decade three general models have been proposed to detect the presence of a major gene. The transmission probability model is a general model for the genetic analysis of pedigree data which tests for Mendelian segregation ratios and is a generalization of the traditional methods of segregation analysis. This model has little power to differentiate between single gene and polygenic inheritance although it may be able to detect some kinds of non-single gene transmission. This method has been extended to allow analysis of multivariate traits, testing of a wide variety of hypotheses concerning modes of transmission and various ascertainment corrections. Major genes identified with this model include hypercholesterolemia, dopamine-beta-hydroxylase, and catechol-o-methytransferase.
 The mixed model includes both a single locus and a multi-locus component and is designed to distinguish between the two. The model assumes that all transmission from one generation to the next that cannot be accounted for by classical polygenic inheritance is due to segregation of alleles at a single locus. It is ideal for detecting a major gene in the presence of polygenic inheritance provided that no other type of transmission is occurring.
 This model has been extended to include an environmental correlation among sibs. Major loci identified with this model include PTC, IgE and congenital glaucoma. The unified model is a mixed model with the single locus component parameterized in terms of transmission probabilities, and is a combination of the two previous models. Several research groups have developed methodologies to overcome the computational difficulties presented by this combined model.
 DESIGN NARRATIVE:
 The study was divided into two parts, the analysis of the methodologies and the application of the methodologies in the genetic analysis of hypertension. In the first part of the study, the power, robustness, and validity of three genetic models of segregation and linkage analysis were considered: the transmission probability model; the mixed model; and the unified model which was also a mixed model with the single locus component parameterized in terms of transmission probabilities. The methods of segregation and linkage analysis found to be most satisfactory were then applied to the analysis of data on five large pedigrees in collaboration with Wright State University and to the analysis of ten large pedigrees ascertained as part of the Bogalusa Heart Study. A determination was made of the effects of partitioning large families into nuclear families and performing segregation and linkage on these nuclear families.

 BACKGROUND:
 Coronary artery disease appears to be a consequence of the interaction between an individual's genotype and exposure to environmental factors. Genetic information has the potential to contribute to the identification of families and individuals with a biological predisposition for developing coronary artery disease. Although numerous studies have suggested the possibility of a link between polymorphic genetic variation and coronary heart disease, it has not been possible to use any single genetic locus or combination of loci to establish a person's risk except for the case of familial hypercholesterolemia.
 Apolipoproteins play a critical role in regulating cellular uptake of lipoproteins by specific receptors, regulating the activities of lipoprotein lipase and lecithin-cholesterol acyl transferase, and in the indirect regulation of the intracellular enzymes, acyl-cholesterol acyl transferase and HMG Co-A reductase. This study provided insight into the role of environmental and genetic effects on phenotypic variation of the individual components of the molecules of lipid metabolism as well as on the relationships between components.
 Previous studies conducted under this grant include: the relationship between quantitative levels of apo A-I and coronary artery disease as defined by coronary angiography; the effects of exercise, alcohol, obesity, and pregnancy on apo A-I levels; the relationship between apo
 A-I and HDL levels in children and the mode of inheritance of apo A-I levels in pedigrees in the Rochester, Minnesota community; and characterization of the antigenic structure of apolipoproteins in coronary artery disease.
 DESIGN NARRATIVE:
 Subjects for the study were drawn from the Rochester Family Heart Study which initiated recruitment for the family study in January 1985. In 31 months of recruitment, 443 households were contacted and 300 agreed to participate. In August 1987 all individuals identified by these households had completed their clinic visits providing 1,999 physical exams. The 300 households yielded 276 three and four generation pedigrees with 593 parents, 598 grandparents, 14 great-grandparents, and 854 children. Disease information was obtained from medical records for an additional 400 grandparents. In 1988 an additional 2,100 individual members of 300 families were surveyed.
 Medical records and death certificates were reviewed to evaluate coronary artery disease endpoints in all adults members of the pedigrees. Clinical data collected included: a history of symptoms of coronary artery disease, arteriosclerosis obliterans, cerebrovascular disease or surgery for these diseases; smoking; medication; history of genetic relationships.
 Measurements were made of cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL and LDL cholesterol, apo A-I, apo
 A-II, apo E, apo C-III, apo C-II, apo B, apo Lp(a), LDL apo B, HDL apo E, and DNA extraction.
 Lipid, lipoprotein, and apolipoprotein phenotypes and the restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP) were measured in candidate genes for coronary artery disease. Genetic and phenotype analyses were conducted at the University of Michigan. The RFLP and apolipoprotein isotyping analyses were conducted at the University of Pittsburgh. RFLP analysis and LDL receptor and A-I gene analysis were conducted at Charing Cross Medical
 Center in London, England.
 The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the End Date entered in the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record."

 BACKGROUND:
 Cardiovascular disease mortality rates, especially for myocardial infarction and stroke, have fallen markedly over the past several decades in all race, sex, and age groups in the United
 States. Between 1966 and 1986, the combined death rate for all cardiovascular diseases declined by 42 percent. In 1986, the death rate for coronary heart disease was 55 percent of what it had been in 1966, and cerebrovascular disease was 42 percent of what it had been in 1966. The decline is assumed to be related to several factors including improved medical care and risk factor modification for elevated blood lipids, cigarette smoking, and hypertension.
 The Minnesota Heart Survey provide trends (1970-2002) in coronary heart disease deaths out-of-hospital, in hospitalization rates, case fatality and survivorship for myocardial infarction and stroke in the metropolitan area.
 DESIGN NARRATIVE:
 Between 1979 and 1999, R01HL23727 supported mortality surveillance and morbidity surveillance. Beginning in FY 2000, R01HL65755 supports the morbidity and mortality surveillance and R01HL23727 supports the risk factor survey.
 Mortality Surveillance: The mortality surveillance was a continuation of a surveillance study performed by the investigators since 1960 for the state of Minnesota. Mortality data for hypertension, stroke, coronary heart disease, and all cardiovascular renal disease were monitored for the Twin City metropolitan area with a total population of two million. Age, sex, area, location of death and cause-specific death rates were followed. Trends in cancer, diabetes, and other non-cardiovascular disease were examined. Case fatality rates, including one- and five-year survivorships were determined and related to coronary heart disease mortality trends.
 Morbidity Surveillance: All discharges from the seven-county area hospitals with acute and chronic myocardial heart disease and stroke listed among the discharge diagnoses were recorded using Professional Standards Review Organization data tapes. A ten percent random sample of all recorded diagnoses were validated yearly by abstracting data from hospital records. Each year's validation sample of definite and probable cases of myocardial infarction and stroke formed a cohort to be followed for mortality for one year after the onset of the disease event. Individual hospitals and the Professional Standards Review
 Organization in the area provided data on the total numbers of coronary care unit admissions and coronary artery bypass operations for each year. Beginning in August 1988, a registry was established for all new incident cases of coronary heart disease at the University of
 Minnesota Hospital and the Ramsey County Hospital. In 1989, twelve hospitals were part of the myocardial infarction registry.
 Risk Factor Surveillance: Population samples, aged 25-74 years, are recruited and measured for blood pressure, serum cholesterol, serum high density lipoprotein cholesterol, cigarette smoking, diet, physical activity, height, weight, health attitudes and beliefs, and coronary prone behavior. Surveys were completed in 1980-1982 and 1984-1985. The third survey conducted in 1990-1992 included the Willett Food Frequency Questionnaire and bioimpedance measurements.
 A nested case-control study using the 1980-1982 risk factor cohort examined the baseline cardiovascular disease risk factor differences between coronary heart disease in cases and controls.
 The study was renewed in the year 2000 under R01HL23727 to conduct a population survey of 4,000 adults, ages 25 to 84 in 2000-2002, to detect current trends in cardiovascular disease risk factors, including serum lipids, blood pressure, cigarette smoking prevalence, dietary fat intake, obesity, diabetes, physical inactivity, fibrinogen, and serum vitamin E. Cohort and ecological analyses will be used to link secular trends in risk factors to morbidity and mortality from coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, and stroke. A total of 1,000 children and adolescents, ages 8-17, will also be surveyed using youth-specific measurement instruments where appropriate."

 BACKGROUND:
 Asthma is a serious chronic condition, affecting approximately 14 million Americans. People with asthma experience well over 100 million days of restricted activity annually, and costs for asthma care exceed $10 billion a year. Asthma is much more prevalent among children than adults.
 Hospitalizations for asthma have been increasing among children. For example, from 1979 to 1987, the hospital discharge rate with asthma as the first-listed diagnosis rose 43 percent among children less than 15 years of age, from 19.8 to 28.4 discharges per 10,000 population.
 Death rates for asthma are greater in Blacks than in whites, and the difference is increasing. In 1979, Blacks of both sexes were about twice as likely to die from asthma as whites. Over the past decade this ratio has increased, and by 1987 the asthma death rate was almost three times greater among Blacks than whites. In children, these mortality differences between Blacks and whites are even more striking.
 Current knowledge about the epidemiology and natural history of childhood asthma is incomplete, but the relationship between asthma early in life and development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in adulthood is becoming more apparent. Asthmatic children with persistent and severe asthma symptoms have lower levels of lung function by young adulthood than those with milder disease. Recent longitudinal studies have confirmed a decrease in rate of growth of lung function as measured by FEV1 among symptomatic (primarily wheeze) children compared to asymptomatic children. Among persons who develop COPD, initial level of lung function is the strongest predictor of subsequent rapid decline of ventilatory function.
 Thus, less than maximally attained levels of lung function among children with asthma may predispose them to greater than normal decline of lung function later in life. Although the long-term effect of treatment on the course of asthma is not known, the treatment goal of decreasing bronchial hyperresponsiveness and maximizing lung function and growth during childhood may have a beneficial effect on lung health throughout life and prevent progression to irreversible airflow obstruction.
 Two classes of medications are currently available for treatment of inflammation--corticosteroids and cromolyn sodium. Inhaled corticosteroids have significantly fewer side effects than systemic administration. Corticosteroids do not inhibit the early asthmatic response, but are effective in suppressing the inflammation and bronchial hyperresponsiveness of the late phase response. Long-term studies of inhaled corticosteroids have shown beneficial effects on lung function as measured by FEV1. However, there has been concern about possible effects of long-term use of inhaled corticosteroids. Although epidemiological studies of the use of inhaled corticosteroids have shown no significant adverse effects, large-scale randomized controlled studies of their effects on children's growth and development are needed.
 When CAMP was initiated in the United States, bronchodilator treatment was the most common approach to therapy. Two classes of bronchodilators, inhaled beta-2-adrenergic agonists and oral theophylline, are most frequently prescribed for asthma. To date, no randomized, controlled studies have compared the two classes of anti-inflammatory medications to each other and to bronchodilator therapy on the course of asthma.
 The initiative was proposed by the Pulmonary Disease Advisory Committee working group in
 October 1987 and approved by the full committee at the February 1988 meeting and by the
 National Heart, Lung, and Blood Advisory Council in May 1990. The Request for Proposals was released in October 1990. Awards were made in September 1991.
 DESIGN NARRATIVE:
 Children were randomized to one of three treatment groups to receive either: inhaled albuterol alone, albuterol with inhaled budesonide, albuterol with nedocromil. Upon randomization, data were collected on demographic factors, physical and psychosocial development, clinical factors including medical history and extent of allergies, and quality of life factors including limitation of activity, absenteeism from school, emergency room visits, and hospitalizations. All subjects received a common educational program, differing only in the information presented regarding the medication used by the subjects. Each subject was given a standard protocol for dealing with asthma attacks. All subjects were treated and followed for five years with quarterly visits yearly. Recruitment began in July 1993 and ended in June 1995 with the accrual of 1,041 subjects.
 The study has been extended through June 2011 through three funding phases to observe the subjects but not provide asthma treatment. This will allow CAMP to (1.) determine the full impact of 4 to 6 years of anti-inflammatory therapy on attaining maximal lung function and final height; (2.) examine the natural history of asthma through age 26; and (3.) define patterns of reduced lung function growth and early decline of lung function in young adults."

 BACKGROUND:
 The prevalence of congestive heart failure increases progressively with advancing age, and congestive heart failure is a major cause of mortality, morbidity, and diminished quality of life in the elderly. Not only is congestive heart failure the most common cardiovascular indication for hospitalization in patients 65 years or older, but frequent repetitive hospitalizations, occurring in 30-50 percent of patients within three to six months of initial discharge, create an imposing cost burden in caring for these patients. A pilot study conducted at the grantee institution has shown that elderly congestive heart failure patients at risk for early readmission can be identified at the time of initial hospitalization, that up to 50 percent of readmissions are potentially preventable, and that a non-pharmacologic treatment strategy consisting of patient education, medication analysis, discharge planning, and enhanced follow-up is feasible and may reduce readmissions by 30 to 50 percent.
 DESIGN NARRATIVE:
 In the feasibility study, patients were randomly assigned to receive intervention or standard care over a four year period. Patients were stratified into readmission risk categories of high or moderate based on the presence of four independent risk factors for readmission defined in a prior study at Jewish Hospital in St. Louis. The risk factors included: four or more prior hospitalizations within the preceding five-year interval, previous history of congestive heart failure, hypocholesterolemia, and right bundle-branch block on the admitting electrocardiogram. The study intervention consisted of individualized patient education using teaching materials specifically designed for the study; a careful review of medications with specific recommendations designed to eliminate unnecessary drugs, decrease the number of dosing intervals, improve compliance, and minimize side effects; early discharge planning; and enhanced post-discharge follow-up. The primary endpoints were rehospitalization within 90 days after initial hospital discharge and the cumulative number of days hospitalized during follow-up. Principal secondary endpoints included analyses of the effect of the study intervention on compliance with prescribed medications, dietary sodium intake, incidence of adverse drug reactions, patient knowledge and understanding of congestive heart failure, patient-assessed quality of life, and the overall cost of medical care.
 In the full-scale trial, 140 patients were assigned to the control group which received all standard treatments and services ordered by their physicians. A total of 142 patients were assigned to the treatment group which received intensive education about congestive heart failure and its treatment by an experienced cardiovascular research nurse, using a teaching booklet developed by study investigators for geriatric patients with heart failure. Treatment group patients also received individualized dietary assessment and instruction given by a registered dietitian; consultation with social-service personnel to facilitate discharge planning and care after discharge; an analysis of medications by a geriatric cardiologist who made specific recommendations to eliminate unnecessary medications and simplify the overall regimen; and intensive follow-up after discharge. The goals of follow-up were to reinforce the patient's education, ensure compliance with medications and diet, and identify recurrent symptoms amenable to treatment on an outpatient basis. The primary outcome measure was survival for 90 days without hospital readmission. Secondary endpoints included the number of readmissions for any cause, the number of readmissions for congestive heart failure, the cumulative number of days of hospitalization during follow-up, quality-of-life scores, and the overall cost of medical care.

 Insulin is the key hormone responsible for regulating the level of glucose in plasma. In several disease states (e.g., obesity, non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, and acromegaly), the target cells are resistant to insulin action. The intramural research program of the NIDDK has a long history of studying patients with rare disorders of extreme insulin resistance. We use what is learned from these rare patients both to develop therapeutics for rare diseases, and to apply what is learned to understand more common forms of insulin resistance.
 The purpose of this protocol is to threefold: 1. To study the molecular genetics underlying various causes of insulin resistance and diabetes mellitus. 2. To understand the natural history of insulin resistance disorders, including their response to FDA approved therapies. However, the treatment aspect of the protocol represents clinical care rather than prospective research. 3. To educate fellows in the Inter-institute Endocrinology and Pediatric Endocrinology programs of the NIH about rare and common insulin resistant disorders.
 Patients with evidence for insulin resistance will be eligible to participate in this study.
 We particularly focus our study on the following four groups of patients: 1. Patients with various syndromes of lipodystrophy 2. Patients with known or suspected mutations on the insulin receptor gene 3. Patients with known or suspected autoantibodies to the insulin receptor 4. Patients with other severe forms of insulin resistance
 The frequency of visits and testing to be performed will vary due to the clinical heterogeneity of the patients studied as well as their worldwide geographic distribution, and will be adjusted on an individual basis. The total quantity of blood collected will be adjusted to remain within the approved NIH guidelines appropriate to the individual s age and size. The testing will include all or some of the following studies:
 -  Fasting blood sampling (e.g. insulin, glucose, HbA1c, lipid profile, lipoprotein profile, IGF-1 level, leptin level)
 -  Urine pregnancy test for applicable patients
 -  adrenal hormones and growth hormone
 -  Oral glucose tolerance test
 -  Stable isotope tracer studies to measure glucose and lipid turnover
 -  Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp studies to measure insulin sensitivity
 -  Analysis of body composition (anthropometric measurements, DEXA, MRI)
 -  Measurement of autoantibodies to the insulin receptor if Type B insulin resistance is suspected
 -  Biopsy of skin for the establishment of fibroblast or induced pluripotential stem cell lines
 -  Biopsies of subcutaneous adipose tissue and/or muscle for gene expression profiling
 -  Biopsies of liver or kidney if clinically indicated in patients with lipodystrophy
 -  Biopsies of thyroid tissue if clinically indicated"

 The Brain Physiology and Metabolism Section (BPMS) of the National Institute on Aging (NIA) and the Clinical Neuroscience Program (CNP) of the National Institute of Neurological
 Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) propose to study regional brain phospholipid metabolism in young and old normal volunteers and in patients with Alzheimer disease. The method to be employed, developed from animal studies, involves the intravenous injection of a radiolabeled polyunsaturated fatty acid, [11C]arachidonic acid and measuring regional brain radioactivity using positron emission tomography (PET). A mathematical model is used to calculate regional brain incorporation coefficients k* of [11C]arachidonate into brain. These reflect brain signal transduction and membrane turnover involving phospholipids and the signal transduction and membrane turnover involving phospholipids and the activation of the enzyme, phospholipase
 A2. PET also will be used in the same subjects to measure regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), a marker of brain energy metabolism, with radioactive water ([150]H20). The literature reports that rCBF and energy metabolism decline with age and are markedly reduced in Alzheimer disease. We hypothesize that (a) we will be able to quantify and image incorporation of [11C]arachidonate into the human brain for the first time, (b) in normal volunteers, k* for arachidonate will be correlated on a regional basis with rCBF, (c) rCBF will be reduced in the older compared with the younger normal volunteers, and markedly reduced in Alzheimer disease patients compared with the older volunteers (controls), (d) the normal coupling (regression) relation between k* and rCBF will be disturbed in Alzheimer disease.
 This protocol originally proposed to measure brain incorporation of two labeled fatty acids,
 [11C]arachidonate and [11C]palmitate, as well as rCBF, in young and old normal volunteers, and in patients with Alzheimer disease, Niemann-Pick Type C disease and brain tumors. Eleven patients with Alzheimer disease have been scanned using [11C]arachidonate and [150]H20, compared with 10 volunteers. The current amendment proposes to use only [11C]arachidonate and
 [150]H20 in 16 additional normal volunteers, and to compare the results between old and young groups and patients with Alzheimer disease. A request to study only 16 additional normal volunteers was approved by the NINDS IRB at the Continuing Review in 1999, and has not changed since then."

 The pathophysiology and anatomical basis of most tremors remains poorly understood. One particular theory of essential tremor, the olivary hypothesis, has gained support from various studies. These studies point to the olivary nucleus as possible central rhythm generator. Cells in the olivary nucleus show spontaneous rhythmic discharges that can be suppressed by alcohol. Since alcohol is known to suppress tremor in some patients with essential tremor, one can theorize that it is through its effect on the olivary nucleus; that is, the inferior olive is the generator of the tremor. Given this assumption, we intend to study the effect of alcohol on three different kinds of tremor: the 8-12 Hz component of physiological tremor, symptomatic palatal tremor and essential palatal tremor. Our hypothesis is that the central generator of each of these types of tremor lies in the inferior olive and that the ingestion of alcohol should reduce the amplitude of the tremor, similar to the effect of alcohol seen in essential tremor."

 This protocol includes studies of genetic defects of the immune system that cause failure of host defenses against infections, immune dysregulation and autoimmune diseases. Numerous rare disorders result from inherited or newly arising mutations in genes involved in the development and function of innate and adaptive immune systems or both. As specific disease syndromes are defined and the responsible genes identified, mutations in individual families can be sought. Correlation of mutation sites with clinical information helps to determine how specific gene segments encode important functional domains of the proteins of the immune system within the same genetic defect. Rare, single gene disorders identify immunologic pathways that might contribute to more common conditions, such as failure to respond to vaccines, susceptibility to allergies, or autoimmune diseases like arthritis or lupus.
 Members of families with immune disorders that are known or suspected to have a genetic basis may be eligible. Immunologic tests and DNA sequence analysis appropriate to each clinical condition will be performed as needed on affected individuals and at risk family members.
 Healthy family members may serve as controls. Probands, parents of deceased affected individuals, or entire families, may be referred to the Investigators Initially, clinical and family history as well as laboratory data will be reviewed by the investigators to determine eligibility. Subjects considered appropriate will be invited through their referring physician to participate by signing our consent form and sending appropriate blood, DNA or other samples to our PI. Should a genetic basis for an individual s immune disorder be identified or if clinical eligibility for other protocols is met, they may be invited to visit NIH."

 Vitamin D and its analogs, the conventional treatment for hypoparathyroidism, are associated with chronic hypercalciuria due to their lack of calcium-retaining effect in the kidney. This side effect usually occurs even while maintaining the serum calcium in the normal range and may lead to calcium deposition in the kidney (nephrocalcinosis) and renal insufficiency. This study examines the long-term effects of subcutaneous parathyroid hormone (PTH) therapy on calcium metabolism, bone, and renal function. Our previous short-term pilot study comparing subcutaneous PTH with calcitriol demonstrated a significant decrease in urinary calcium excretion during PTH therapy. Based upon these results, we hypothesized that treatment with
 PTH is more physiologic and provides improved long-term metabolic control. Additionally, treatment with PTH may avoid the adverse side effects on the kidney that are associated with conventional therapy. Patients initially come to the Clinical Center for a two week inpatient evaluation. Subsequent follow-up will occur semiannually on an outpatient basis."

 Endotoxin is a unique molecule because it represents an important probe for investigating the humoral and cellular basis of septic shock. Endotoxin administration to humans provides an opportunity to evaluate the earliest responses that are activated after exposure to an important bacterial component. Many alterations in organ function and circulating mediators can be evaluated in this model. These changes are qualitatively similar to changes that occur during sepsis and septic shock. The applications of new technologies to this model are useful adjuncts to define mechanisms of acute inflammatory responses. Defining these pathways and their interactions may allow a better understanding of the factors that can be controlled or altered during critical illness.
 In the current study, we are planning to extend previous observations on heart and lung function after endotoxin administration in four separate studies. 1. Bronchoalveolar lavage and bronchial brushings in normal subjects. Bronchoalveolar lavage and bronchial brushings will be performed in normal subjects to obtain alveolar and epithelial pulmonary cells for use in vitro assays of respiratory cell function. 2. Inflammatory effects of systemic endotoxin administration. In order to evaluate late inflammatory responses to IV endotoxin, blood will be obtained acutely and at 1, 2, 3, 7, and 14 days post endotoxin challenge. 3. Pulmonary effects of instilled endotoxin. Using bronchoscopy, the effects of direct instillation of endotoxin into a lobe of the lung is being used to assess local pulmonary inflammatory responses that result in neutrophil influx into the lung. 4. Effects of inhaled nitric oxide on pulmonary inflammatory responses following endotoxin administration. In order to systematically study the effects of inhaled nitric oxide on local lung inflammation, healthy subjects will undergo local endotoxin instillation, breath NO through a mask for 6h, and then a repeat bronchoscopy will be done at 6h to assess the ability of NO to suppress local inflammation in the lung."

 The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of mycophenolate mofetil in the treatment of Wegener's granulomatosis and related vasculitides in patients who have contraindications to methotrexate or cyclophosphamide or have experienced disease relapse while on these agents. Mycophenolate mofetil is a novel immunosuppressive agent which has been approved by the FDA for renal transplantation. It is chemically similar to and has a potentially greater efficacy in preventing acute transplant rejection than azathioprine, a drug which has been previously used as an alternative treatment for vasculitis. In this study, patients who have had disease relapse or contraindications to methotrexate will initially receive cyclophosphamide and glucocorticoids and then switch from cyclophosphamide to mycophenolate mofetil upon disease remission. If at the end of two years of mycophenolate mofetil therapy there is continued evidence of disease remission, the drug will be tapered and discontinued. Patients with contraindications to both cyclophosphamide and methotrexate will be treated initially with prednisone and mycophenolate mofetil with mycophenolate mofetil being continued for two full years after disease remission and then tapered and discontinued. For patients who develop intolerance to methotrexate or cyclophosphamide while their disease is in remission, mycophenolate mofetil will be started and continued for two years after which time it will be tapered and discontinued. Patients will be prospectively monitored for evidence of disease activity and drug toxicity. Specific parameters that will be obtained include the time to disease remission, the rate and time of disease relapse, and the incidence of drug related adverse effects."

 This study began as an efficacy study of interferon alpha-2a in patients with hairy cell leukemia. It was observed that most patients responded with interferon, but that very few complete responses were being obtained. Studies being done elsewhere confirmed the low complete remission rate. Once interferon was stopped, nearly uniform disease progression requiring reinstitution of therapy was observed. There appears to be very few if any patients who will not require further therapy after receiving 12 or 18 months of continuous interferon treatment. Because of these findings, and in order to evaluate the safety and efficacy of long-term recombinant interferon-alpha (IFN-Alpha) in patients with hairy cell leukemia, we opted to administer interferon continuously to patients who were initially responsive to this drug. Of the 53 evaluable patients (of the 56 entered on this study), there was one complete remission, 41 partial remissions, 1 minor response, 9 patients with stable disease and only 1 patient with disease progression. Fourteen patients continue to receive interferon without interruption with a median duration of continuous interferon treatment of 9.2 years.
 Thirty-four patients discontinued interferon for a variety of reasons, the most common being the development of acquired interferon resistance in association with interferon antibodies.
 The resistance to interferon was manifested early, in the first 18 months of treatment, except in two cases. An important finding in this study is the continued slow, but significant, hematologic improvement in absolute granulocyte and platelet counts beyond 18 months of therapy, thereby indicating that prolonged treatment results in continued benefit rather than the production of antibodies with subsequent development of interferon resistance. Although it is clear from this study that hairy cell leukemia can be controlled in the long-term with interferon, longer follow-up will be necessary to determine if continuous therapy with interferon is better than intermittent therapy. The optimal therapy for hairy cell leukemia remains open to discussion. Although early reports suggested that 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine was curative, additional studies with longer periods of follow up suggest that as many as 30% of patients will relapse. This study provides the only instance where continuous long term treatment with interferon has been evaluated. This provides an opportunity to evaluate the long term toxicity of chronic interferon therapy, the long term efficacy of this treatment and to evaluate the potential benefits of long term interferon in preventing second malignancies, a complication noted in about 15% of patients treated in other fashions.
 After their initial clinical evaluation, patients were given 3 million units of recombinant
 IFN-Alpha subcutaneously daily for 4 to 6 months. In responding patients, maintenance therapy was given at a dose of 3 million units subcutaneously 3 times per week. Responding patients have continued on therapy indefinitely."

 Uveitis refers to intraocular inflammatory diseases that are an important cause of visual loss. Standard systemic immunosuppressive medications for uveitis can cause significant adverse effects. Consequently, an effective treatment with a safer side effect profile is highly desirable.
 This pilot study has permitted enrollment of up to 12 adults with non-infectious intermediate or posterior uveitis who require treatments to maintain visual function. This extended protocol began with an evaluation of the safety and potential efficacy of intravenous (IV) daclizumab treatments for uveitis while reducing or eliminating standard medications commensurate with the standard of care. As subcutaneous (SC) daclizumab treatments become available, eligible participants will be offered continuing daclizumab treatments using the new SC formulation, though they may elect to remain on the IV treatments. If the therapeutic benefit is sustained using the SC formulation, maintenance therapy will continue as clinically indicated. Participants who repeatedly fail the SC therapy will be permitted to revert to the IV daclizumab regimen they previously used, or may exit the study as treatment failures. SC treatments begin with a short SC induction at 2 mg/kg followed by 1 mg/kg treatments on a 4-week schedule as the protocol originally specified. Participants will be monitored routinely when each dose is received and additionally will participate in pharmacokinetic studies to monitor SC formulation bioavailability.
 Daclizumab is a humanized anti-Tac monoclonal antibody (HAT, Zenapax) that interferes with inflammatory processes by its involvement with the interleukin 2 receptor (IL-2R). During the first 5 years of this study, only an IV product was available. The SC formulation is now available containing the same daclizumab drug product. Preliminary studies indicate that the
 SC formulation is well tolerated by normal control subjects and other autoimmune disease patients at repeated doses up to 2 mg/kg.
 The primary objectives are to examine the safety and potential efficacy of IV and later, SC daclizumab, while continuing to reduce other immunosuppressive medications commensurate with the standard of care. Primary safety outcomes are the discontinuation of study therapy due to reduced vision or the occurrence of adverse events. Secondary outcome measures include visual acuity and the grading of immunosuppressive medications, anterior chamber and vitreous cells, and vitreous haze."

 The purposes of this protocol are two-fold: 1) to determine whether deferoxamine, given subcutaneously on a regular basis, can indefinitely prevent the cardiac, endocrine and hepatic complications of transfusional hemochromatosis; and 2) to determine whether cardiac disease can be reversed by intensive intravenous treatment in patients who already have objective evidence of cardiac dysfunction. The clinical manifestations and course of patients who require regular blood transfusions is well established. Those with congenital anemias who require transfusions from birth develop cardiac disease in their teens and their mean of survival is only 17 years. Adults with acquired anemias begin to exhibit cardiac manifestations of iron deposition after 100-200 units of packed red cells. Deferoxamine, when given by the subcutaneous route, has been shown to reduce substantially the total iron burden in thalassemic patients. Our results indicate that cardiac complications are delayed or prevented. We plan to continue to follow our cohort of patients on optimal medical management to determine if chelation alters disease outcome. Patients with heavy iron burdens who already manifest cardiac disease will be chelated intensely to determine whether reducing the iron burden is associated with reversal of cardiac complications."

 Protocol 86-EI-0062 began as a randomized, double-masked, placebo controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 0.5% topical cysteamine but was subsequently amended as a natural history protocol. Additional protocols conducted at the National Eye Institute (NEI) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) began after this protocol and tested various formulations of cysteamine topical solution for efficacy and safety in patients with cystinosis. Subjects from these NIH protocols testing various formulations were ultimately transferred to this natural history protocol for open-label treatment once it was established that the formulation within this study was the most effective. All subjects enrolled in this protocol received the most effective cysteamine topical solution formulation in both eyes.
 The control was defined as the natural course of corneal crystal accumulation in patients with cystinosis. The efficacy data were obtained from all of the studies conducted at NIH evaluating various cysteamine ophthalmic solution formulations from 1986 until 2005. The safety data were collected from 1986 until the termination of this protocol in July 2013.
 OBJECTIVE:
 The free thiol cysteamine depletes cystinotic leukocytes and other cells of cystine, whose accumulation is considered the cause of organ damage in cystinosis. This organ damage involves most tissues of the body. Cysteamine therapy improved growth and stabilized renal function in pre-renal transplant cystinosis, without substantial toxicity but there was no noticeable effect on cystine crystal accumulation in the cornea, most likely because of inadequate local cysteamine concentration in the cornea. Previous studies have shown the safety of cysteamine 0.5% topical solution in benzalkonium chloride and its efficacy in resolving the cystine corneal crystals. The main purpose of this protocol is to maintain topical cysteamine treatment in patients with nephropathic cystinosis until the drops are approved by the FDA. When the NDA for the Sigma-Tau standard formulation is granted, the present protocol (86-EI-0062) will be terminated.
 STUDY POPULATION:
 Up to 350 adults and children over two years old, who have a confirmed diagnosis of cystinosis will be enrolled.
 STUDY DESIGN:
 This is an open label treatment protocol. Eligible subjects will receive drops of cysteamine 0.5% topical solution in benzalkonium chloride hourly while awake in both eyes. They will undergo an eye examination at their baseline visit. They will take cysteamine eye drops in both eyes every hour during waking hours. They will return to the NIH Clinical Center for a follow-up safety eye examination one year after the baseline visit, and then every two years thereafter until the drug is available commercially.
 OUTCOME MEASURES:
 The initial pre-specified primary outcome measure was the reduction of cystine corneal crystals. The post-hoc primary outcome measure (after the protocol was modified) was the collection of safety data."

 BACKGROUND:
 Venous thromboembolism is a common condition with considerable morbidity and mortality. The disorder has diverse causes including trauma, stasis, drugs, cancer, and genetic factors that contribute to enhanced clotting and coagulation. The study uses existing large-scale population studies to unravel factors responsible for and contributing to venous thromboembolism.
 DESIGN NARRATIVE:
 The study design is a prospective cohort study of 77,118 persons based on pooling information from four large randomized trials of US health professionals that have collected detailed risk factor information and have used common strategies to prospectively identify and validate cases of venous thromboembolism (VTE). These trials are: Physicians' Health Studies
 I & II including 29,071 US male physicians, of whom 22,071 have been followed since the initiation of the first trial in 1982; the Women's Health Study including 39,876 female health professionals who will have an average of 10 years of follow-up; and the Women's
 Antioxidant Cardiovascular Study including 8,171 female health professionals with prevalent cardiovascular disease or at high risk of cardiovascular disease who will have an average of 8 years of follow-up. Archived blood samples were collected from approximately 75 percent of participants at baseline and will be used to assess biochemical and genetic markers of risk including factor V Leiden, the G20210A mutation in the prothrombin gene, hyperhomocysteinemia, and anticardiolipin antibodies. The study will assess the joint association with risk of these markers and potentially modifiable factors including body mass index, hormone replacement therapy, physical activity, and aspirin use. The study population will include over 1,000 incident cases of VTE, including 750 with blood samples."

 The overall goal of this line of investigation is to evaluate the efficacy of an integrated cardiovascular amputation rehabilitation program (Healthy Heart Amputation Rehabilitation
 Therapy (Healthy H.A.R.T.)) that concentrates on secondary CV risk factor modification and utilizes an aggressive exercise program to: 1) increase aerobic capacity and promote rehabilitation achievements and quality of life and 2) prevent postoperative complications and curtail further peripheral vascular deterioration. Given the recognized merits of systematically building upon incremental research achievements to develop comprehensive and multi-faceted clinical programs, we will study the above one step at a time, working up to more wide-scale investigations of the benefits of the integrated Healthy H.A.R.T. program as conceptualized. The following phases are planned:
 Part 1 (this proposed 3-year study): examining the clinical effectiveness of Healthy
 H.A.R.T.'s exercise components. Findings will be disseminated through presentations and publications during and immediately following study completion.
 Part 2: revising amputation rehabilitation and P.A.C.T. program care algorithms as indicated by Phase 1 findings.
 Part 3: investigating how to implement Healthy H.A.R.T.'s exercise components in distance, off-site, and home-based programs.
 Part 4: developing broader scale investigations of additional components of Healthy H.A.R.T. using physiologic and patient care outcome measures, cost-benefit ratios, patient and clinician satisfaction, and service potential offset by resource utilization and expense reports for widespread application.
 Key Question/Hypothesis: In Healthy H.A.R.T. Part 1, we will test the hypothesis: Dysvascular amputees participating in an aggressive exercise program (Healthy H.A.R.T. exercise) in conjunction with amputation rehabilitation will obtain a greater aerobic capacity and exhibit better rehabilitation achievements and quality of life than those receiving conventional amputation.
 Experimental Design: This study (Healthy Heart Amputation Rehabilitation Therapy (Healthy
 HART) - Part 1) involves an intent-to-treat designed randomized 2-group pre- and post-intervention study to examine if conventional rehabilitation augmented by Healthy
 H.A.R.T. exercise: a) increases aerobic capacity, b) promotes rehabilitation achievements, and c) improves quality of life. Last, cost estimates of the two therapies will be compared.

 HCV infection is an increasingly important clinical problem in patients infected with HIV. In
 HIV-uninfected patients with acute HCV infection, the presence of vigorous T-cell proliferative responses to HCV proteins is associated with normalization of serum transaminase levels and viral clearance. Furthermore, early results suggest IL-2 may improve transaminase levels in HCV/HIV patients. These observations provide the rationale for an immune-based therapeutic approach to HCV/HIV coinfection. This study explores the use of initial immunostimulatory therapy with IL-2 followed by the addition of antiviral therapy with PEG-IFN alfa-2b and RBV, as a possible synergistic approach to treatment.
 Patients receive IL-2 for 12 weeks followed by the addition of PEG-IFN alfa-2b and RBV at the
 Week 12 visit. Patients remain on IL-2, PEG-IFN alfa-2b, and RBV for an additional 48 weeks.

 Reports suggest that many HIV-infected patients on antiretroviral therapy experience an increase in abdominal fat. The mechanisms of abdominal fat accumulation in HIV-infected patients are not known. Studies have shown: treatment with testosterone gel reduces total body fat in young, androgen-deficient men; testosterone replacement in middle-aged men with mid-segment obesity decreases visceral fat; and replacement doses of testosterone decrease fat mass and augment lean body mass in HIV-infected men with androgen deficiency. Therefore, there is a strong rationale for evaluating the effectiveness of testosterone replacement in
 HIV-infected men with visceral obesity and low testosterone levels.
 Patients are stratified based on their viral load. Patients receive either testosterone gel or placebo applied to the skin once daily for 24 weeks. Patients remain on their current antiretroviral regimens, which are not supplied through the study.

 The natural history and pathogenesis of HIV-1 infection are linked closely to the replication of virus in the body. Studies obtained entirely from analyses of peripheral blood led to a shift in the understanding of HIV-1 pathogenesis. Recent studies have shown that lymphoid tissues are a major reservoir for HIV and the primary site of virus replication. The proposed studies will provide the first comprehensive assessment of HIV-1 expression and lymphocyte response in both blood and lymphocyte tissue compartments. The data obtained will provide new insight into HIV-1 pathogenesis and provide a more rational basis for treatment decisions concerning early therapy of HIV-1 infection.

 The current optimal clinical management of HIV infection involves therapy with combinations of nucleoside and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and HIV protease inhibitors.
 These regimens, though effective, do not completely eliminate HIV and the development of drug resistance is a major clinical problem. Interferons have been proposed as a possible treatment of HIV. Interferon-alfa inhibits HIV replication in vitro, and HIV-infected patients appear to have reduced production of interferons. Previous short-term clinical studies in adults showed anti-HIV activity, although there were safety and tolerability problems associated with the higher dose regimens used. This study will utilize a rising multiple-dose design to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of single and multiple doses of PEG-Intron in HIV-infected children.
 In a dose-escalation study, patients add weekly PEG-Intron to their antiretroviral therapy for up to 6 weeks. The first 2 doses are received in the clinic where parents/guardians are trained to administer injections, and succeeding doses are given at home.
 Patients are enrolled from 2 cohorts. An older cohort of ages 2 to 16 years receives
 PEG-Intron at the lowest drug level. If the dose is tolerated, patients are added and if safety criteria are met, patients are enrolled in the next higher dose level. The dose level will be increased similarly for up to 4 doses. An optimal dose level is chosen.
 Cohort II patients are a younger group ranging from 3 months to under 2 years of age.
 Patients initially receive the next lower PEG-Intron dose to the optimal dose identified in
 Cohort I [AS PER AMENDMENT 07/23/01: or 1 microg/kg if the optimal dose proves to be 1 microg/kg]. If this dose is safely tolerated, additional patients are added. If this dose level meets safety criteria, patients are enrolled to receive the optimal dose level.

 Dementia is frequently observed in the elderly, often associated with psychotic symptoms such as delusion or hallucinations, or with behavioral disturbances such as aggressive behavior, wandering, and aimless behavior induced by the psychotic symptoms. This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the effectiveness and safety of risperidone (taken twice daily over 8 weeks) in the treatment of psychotic symptoms in patients with Alzheimer's disease.
 Assessments of effectiveness include: Behavioral Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease (BEHAVE-AD), a scale used for global assessment of symptoms associated with dementia; the

 The purpose of this project is to evaluate the ability of a heparin-surface modified intraocular lens to reduce the incidence and severity of post-operative inflammation in patients with uveitis undergoing extracapsular cataract surgery. Patients who have a history of uveitis and have been in remission on steroids and/or cyclosporine or cytotoxic agents for at least three months will be considered for this study. They will be randomized in a masked fashion to either a surface-modified lens or to a non-modified lens of similar design. The intraocular inflammation will be assessed using standardized clinical criteria, and by a laser cell flare meter at those sites using this equipment. The presence of inflammatory cells on the lens surface will be assessed using specular micrography. In an initial period, the study will only be carried out in the Clinical Center of the National Eye Institute (NEI) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). However, in order to complete the study in a reasonable period of time, it may be expanded to include several outside centers."

 The expression of P-glycoprotein, a transporter protein present in enterocytes as well as other cells involved in the absorption and distribution of HIV protease inhibitors, has been linked to a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in exon 26 of the MDR1 gene, C3435T.
 Individuals homozygous for the T allele have reduced P-gp expression compared to CC individuals. Preliminary studies by other investigators to determine the influence of MDR1 genotype on HIV protease inhibitor pharmacokinetics have yielded inconclusive results. The primary purpose of this study is to determine the relationship, if any, between MDR1 genotypes and plasma concentrations of the HIV protease inhibitors indinavir and saquinavir.
 Secondary objectives of this investigation will (1) assess the relationship between CYP3A4 activity and indinavir and saquinavir exposure and (2) characterize the relationship, if any, between P-gp expression on lymphocyte surfaces and MDR1 genotype. Up to 150 subjects will be screened to enroll a total of 63 healthy volunteers (21 subjects each in the CC, TT, and CT groups). Each subject will have blood drawn for P-gp expression analysis and MDR1 genotyping at screening. Next, subjects will receive oral midazolam 8 mg for CYP3A4 phenotyping; a single blood sample will be collected 4 hours after midazolam administration for determination of midazolam and 1-hydroxymidazolam. Between 7 and 28 days after midazolam administration, subjects will receive indinavir 800 mg every 8 hours for one day and a single 800 mg dose the next morning (dose #4). Between 7 and 28 days after indinavir administration, subjects will receive saquinavir soft-gel capsules 1200 mg three times daily for 3 days and a single dose on the morning of day 4 (dose # 10). Post-dose blood samples will be collected over 8 hours following dose #4 of indinavir and dose #10 of saquinavir. Indinavir and saquinavir pharmacokinetic parameters (primarily AUC and Cmax) will be compared across MDR1 genotype groups using ANOVA with post-hoc testing. 1-hydroxymidazolam: midazolam ratios will be correlated to indinavir and saquinavir AUCs as well as compared across MDR1 genotype groups. P-gp expression on lymphocyte surfaces will be determined by flow cytometry, quantified, and compared across MDR1 genotype groups. Data from this investigation will determine whether MDR1 genotype influences protease inhibitor plasma concentrations."

 In recent years the usefulness of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and vasodilators as well as beta-blockers has been realized in the treatment of heart failure. Multi-center studies clinical trials have shown some benefit of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors on the morbidity and mortality of heart failure subjects, and physicians are also prescribing angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors for the initial treatment of subjects with left ventricular dysfunction. Some subjects do not respond to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and intolerance to these compounds has also been observed. Despite the significant reduction in mortality observed in limited controlled studies, the 5-year mortality of subjects with congestive heart failure continues to be high, indicating that there is a significant therapeutic gap in the treatment of this disease.
 MCC-135 is being studied to assess its usefulness as a supplement or replacement to current treatment and to provide subjects with specific and predictable therapy that will reverse the remodeling of the diseased heart and markedly improve the subject's survival. The current study is an exploratory clinical trial to determine the efficacy of two doses and two dose regimens of MCC-135 when compared to placebo by evaluating improvement in the subject's plasma b-type (brain) natriuretic peptide levels, regular rate (heart rate) variability and clinical signs and symptoms."

 The renin angiotensin system (RAS) plays an important physiological and pathophysiological role in the control of blood pressure and plasma volume. Inhibition of the RAS is useful in the treatment of hypertension, cardiac failure and in some patients with myocardial infarction. Several recent clinical trials with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) have shown that they also reduce the incidence of myocardial infarction, but the mechanisms underlying this anti-ischemic effect are poorly understood. ACEI reduce angiotensin II synthesis and prevent bradykinin degradation. Results from ongoing studies in the Cardiology Branch (Protocol 95-H-0099) designed to investigate the link between ACEI and the vascular endothelium indicate that ACEI improve both endothelial dysfunction and metabolic coronary vasodilation, an effect that is partially mediated by bradykinin. The current protocol is designed to investigate whether the beneficial effects of ACEI on endothelial function are also partly due to inhibition of angiotensin II. The recent development of selective angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonists allows us to specifically examine the effects of angiotensin II on vasomotor activity."
NCT00001554,382804,2018-10-25T00:00:00Z,Clinical Trial Description,382804,AACT,"
 It is important during neurosurgical procedures to identify and preserve eloquent functional cortex adjacent to a resectable lesion. Resection of a lesion infiltrating vital cerebral cortex can be associated with postoperative neurological deficits if the surgeon cannot clearly distinguish between the infiltrating borders of a lesion and surrounding functionally eloquent tissue. Spatial relationships between a lesion and surrounding normal brain can change significantly from those determined by preoperative methods such as CT and MRI scans.
 Necessary intraoperative interventions such as cerebrospinal fluid drainage, osmotic diuresis and lesion debulking cause quantitatively unpredictable brain shift in three dimensions.
 Therefore functional localization in real time that can be performed in the operating room is desirable. However, intraoperative real-time functional mapping techniques now available cannot be used in many surgical situations and are not sufficiently reliable in all cases in which they are used.
 We have developed an intraoperative approach that may permit reliable lesion localization and brain functional mapping in real time with minimal risk. This approach makes use of infrared technology to identify functionally active eloquent cortex and may differentiate abnormal tissue from normal cortex.
 The goal of this study is to investigate the clinical use of intraoperative infrared (IR) neuroimaging to differentiate intracranial lesions from surrounding normal functionally important tissue in real time. Reliable real-time intraoperative functional mapping of eloquent cortex adjacent to lesions by this technique would improve the safety and effectiveness of many neurosurgical procedures."

 Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is the deadliest, most disabling, and least treatable form of stroke. Approximately 40% of patients die within 1 month of ICH onset, and two-thirds of survivors never regain functional independence. Though guidelines for supportive care exist, there is currently no treatment that has been shown in a randomized-controlled trial to definitely improve outcome after ICH. Hematoma volume is a critical determinant of mortality and functional outcome after ICH, and early hematoma growth may be an important cause of early neurological deterioration.
 Considerable clinical interest has been given to the relationship between antiplatelet and antithrombotic treatment and ICH.
 The reported incidence of major bleeding events in patients undergoing antithrombotic treatment is 5-11/1,000 patients/year, while the overall range of hemorrhages is about 62/1,000 patients/year.In the patients treated with antithrombotic drugs (oral anticoagulants or antiplatelets agent) the incidence rate of ICH has been shown higher than in the general population. Moreover, the mortality rate for both spontaneous and post-traumatic events is higher in antithrombotic treated patients than in controls. [14,15] rFVIIa has been successfully used to control ICH in patients with hemophilia or other coagulation disorders, and can arrest intraoperative bleeding and reverse coagulopathies in patients undergoing neurosurgical procedures.[19] rFVIIa has also been reported to prevent or minimize refractory bleeding in non-coagulopathic patients."

 Family doctors and nurses (health care providers – HCP) recommend that their patients are physically active because this is one of the most important things that patients can do to benefit their health. The Physical Activity Counselling (PAC) randomized controlled trial examined what happens when a physical activity counsellor is added to the family health care team. For the project, HCPs did a brief, 2-4 minute counselling session with their patients who reported doing less than 150 minutes of physical activity a week. Half (59) of the patients in the PAC Project only received this brief counselling from their HCP (brief counselling group) while the other half (61) also received six sessions with the physical activity counsellor over a three month period (intensive counselling group). The purpose of the project was to compare these 2 groups. The HCPs and the PAC used the 7 As shared-care model for physical activity counselling in primary care (Fortier et al., 2006). The HCPs and the PAC tried to help the patients want to (be motivated to) and to feel able to (be confident that they can) increase their level of physical activity. A number of validated questionnaires as well as some interviews were used to look at the effects of the counselling on motivation, confidence and physical activity. As well patients wore wear a small gadget known as an accelerometer to measure their actual physical activity. Quality of life was measured in all patients. Some patients (one third) had physical and metabolic testing three times during the trial. The cost of adding a PAC to a family health care team was also assessed."

 Cardiac troponin I is routinely used in the emergency department as a risk stratification tool for detecting myocardial necrosis in patients with possible acute coronary syndrome. It is our hypothesis that having bedside, point-of-care testing for TnI in the ED will decrease time needed to disposition patients to home from the ED or send to the cardiac catheterization laboratory or intensive care setting. Similarly, having point-of-care testing in the ED should decrease the time required to deliver anti-platelet drugs such as aspirin and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors and anti-thrombin agents such as heparin to high risk patients found to have a positive TnI test. This will be evaluated in a randomized, controlled clinical trial of 2000 patients.

 Mood disorders are important public health problems. Bipolar disorder is a major psychiatric disorder characterized by mood cycles alternating between mania and depression and affects approximately 1% of the population. Most patients are treated beginning in the early twenties and then embark on a course marked by multiple recurrences, hospitalizations, and encounters with legal authorities. These disorders inflict substantial morbidity which yields important deficits in occupational and interpersonal function. The risk of suicide in mood disorders may be as high as 10%.
 Although the outlook for recovery from acute manic or depressive episodes is generally excellent, the long-term prognosis of the disorder varies tremendously across the patient population. The introduction of lithium, anticonvulsants and atypical antipsychotics significantly changes the outlook for bipolar disorder, with some individuals on chronic treatment attaining complete remission and indefinite prophylaxis against mood episodes.
 However, such optimum outcomes may be limited to as few as one-third to one-half of all treated patients. The remaining experiences various combinations of breakthrough mood episodes, including chronic mood instability, persistent depression, and rapid cycling.
 Very little research has been conducted with bipolar disorder, and no medications have an FDA indication to treat bipolar depression. Previous studies suggest that Depakote is promising in the treatment of mixed and depressed episodes of bipolar disorder. This study utilizes the extended release formulation of divalproex sodium, with demonstrated increased tolerability.
 We propose investigating safety, tolerability and efficacy of Depakote ER monotherapy in
 Bipolar I, II or NOS depression, and monitoring associated changes in brain GABA levels. In addition, we intend to evaluate and assess the differences between brain metabolic rate and
 GABA levels in bipolar disorder patients and healthy volunteers."

 The impact of alcoholism can be reduced through effective treatments, which may include medical, psychological, and social interventions. The main goals of alcohol-dependence treatment are to assist patients in avoiding alcohol, developing better strategies for managing stress, and improving self-esteem and quality of life. Studies have demonstrated that treatments for alcohol use disorders can be effective, but their effectiveness is often limited. Although the optimal goal of treatment should be total abstinence, even patients who are unable to achieve this goal may still benefit from treatments leading to a reduction in drinking. Medications are commonly used in other addictive disorders, such as nicotine and opioid dependence, suggesting that this intervention could be useful in the treatment of alcohol dependence. This is a randomized, double-blind, flexible dose study to determine if topiramate, a prescription medication approved by the Food & Drug Administration for the treatment of epilepsy and the prevention of migraine, administered at a dose of 300mg per day or the subject's maximum tolerated dose, is safe and effective compared with placebo in patients with alcohol dependence. The study hypothesis is that topiramate will be more effective than placebo in reducing the percentage of heavy drinking days (5 or more standard drinks per day for men and 4 or more standard drinks per day for women) in patients with alcohol dependence. The patients will receive topiramate tablets (25mg and/or 100mg) or matching placebo. Study medication is taken in increasing doses starting at 25 mg/day up to 300 mg per day (or maximum tolerated dose) during the first 6 weeks and the achieved dose is maintained for an additional 8 weeks."

 Based on the above preclinical and Phase I results, a logical strategy for a second generation melanoma vaccine has emerged. A randomized Phase II study in metastatic melanoma patients will be undertaken. Patients first will be HLA-typed; HLA-A2-positive patients will be eligible for screening. When feasible, each patient will undergo a tumor biopsy to screen for expression of MAGE-3, Melan-A, gplOO, and NAI 7 using RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry, to determine whether T cells are present in the lesion, to measure cytokine gene expression by
 RT-PCR, and to perform gene array analysis. In addition, blood cells will be analyzed for certain parameters of T cell function.
 Patients will be randomized to cohorts A (no IL-2) or B (with low-dose IL-2). For treatment, peripheral blood will be collected and fractionated by density centrifugation to isolate PBMC as a source of APC. The PBMC will be divided into four pools, each of which will be incubated with one of the following peptides: MAGE-3, Melan-A, gp 100, or Ni 7A. The peptide-loaded cells will then be washed and recombined into a single suspension in PBS, and lethally irradiated. Approximately 120 x 106 pulsed cells will be injected subcutaneously at a site near a lymph node not thought to be involved with tumor. The subcutaneous route has been selected for the reasons of safety, efficacy in the preclinical model, and the goal of targeting the vaccine to a draining lymph node. rhIL-12 (4 .tg straight dose) will then be given subcutaneously adjacent to the vaccine site days 1,3, and 5 of each cycle. This dose and schedule was found to be effective in our phase I study. In one-half of the patients (cohort B), IL-2 (I MU straight dose) will be administered subcutaneously daily, days 7-18.
 Re-immunization along with rhIL-12 followed by IL-2 (if assigned) will be performed at 3 week intervals as in cycle I.
 On day 1 of each cycle, peripheral blood will be collected to measure peptide-specific IFN-y production. Before treatment and after every 3 cycles, PBMC will be collected to quantify peptide specific CD8 T cells by flow cytometric analysis with peptide/HLA-A2 tetramers, and evidence for a molecular response will be assessed by performing RT-PCR. for melanoma antigens on peripheral blood samples. In addition, prior to treatment, after the first 3 cycles, and at the time of going off- study, a tumor biopsy will be performed to assess the immune response in the tumor microenvironment, including gene array analysis. It is hoped that these studies will uncover the reason for lack of clinical response in patients with residual tumors. Clinical response will be assessed as a secondary outcome."

 Kidney transplantation has emerged as a desired treatment of choice for patients with end stage renal disease. Although transplantation has become increasingly successful, there continues to be risks associated with it. Prior to performing a kidney transplant patients are cross-matched (a test to determine whether or not they have preformed antibodies to the donor). Preformed antibodies result from a previous pregnancy, blood or platelet transfusion or prior transplant. Performing a transplant in patients who have preformed antibodies against the donor generally results in hyperacute rejection (when the immune system attacks the new kidney). This hyperacute rejection usually results in kidney loss in a very high percentage of patients. Due to these consequences, pre-transplant cross-matching has emerged as a standard of care. Although hyperacute kidney loss has now been avoided, a large population of highly sensitized patients that has little hope of receiving a transplant has been identified.
 A number of groups have studied methods to lower specific antibody levels in a variety of clinical settings. The two primary methods used today in transplantation are plasmapheresis (the separation of plasma from cells, and the removal of solutes, immune globulins, and medications) and administration of immune globulin therapy. Employing either of these techniques individually or jointly has substantially reduced acute rejection and improved kidney survival in these highly sensitized patients. The immune globulin treatments that have been studied have included large variations in dosage as well as differences in immune globulin products. The results from these small studies have not identified one therapy, product or dosage that could be considered standard of care.
 The kidney transplant work-up also consists of matching ABO blood group between donor and recipient. Transplantation against the recipient blood group has resulted in very poor outcomes due to antibody mediated rejection (when the immune system attacks the kidney).
 However, due to the shortage of organs available for transplantation, the increasing number of patients awaiting a transplant and the favorable outcomes with live donor transplant, some transplant programs have developed protocols for transplanting against the recipient ABO blood group. These protocols are centered around plasmapheresis and treatment with immune globulin. As with the positive cross-match patients stated earlier, the standard of care has yet to be identified.
 Dr. Lloyd Ratner, currently at Columbia University and former Chief of Transplant at Thomas
 Jefferson University Hospital and his former colleagues at Johns Hopkins University have studied the use of plasmapheresis in combination with Cytomegalovirus Immune Globulin
 Intravenous (CytoGam) to reverse a positive cross match and to transplant organs against ABO incompatible blood groups. This has enabled over 20 kidney transplants to be performed with patient and graft survival at one year being very similar to our traditional cross match negative and ABO compatible patients. These results are generally considered outstanding given the fact that antibody mediated rejection historically had a 75 to 100% incidence of graft loss.
 The treatment protocol that is used consists of plasmapheresis treatments alternating with
 CytoGam infusions every other day for 3 to 9 treatments prior to transplantation and another 1-5 treatments after transplant. Plasmapheresis is increasingly performed to treat various infectious, immunological, metabolic and inherited diseases. In this procedure, plasma and cellular components of blood are separated and solutes in plasma, including drugs may be removed. Generally, a volume of 1 to 1.5 times the plasma volume is removed and replaced with an equivalent volume of crystalloid or colloid. The procedure removes solutes or drugs from the blood compartment and the tissue stores remain unaffected except for re-equilibration with decreasing plasma concentrations. After each plasmapheresis treatment patients receive an infusion of CytoGam which is used to inactivate the remaining antibody. However, it is not known to what extent subsequent treatments of plasmapheresis remove CytoGam that patients received only hours or days prior.
 During the treatment phase with plasmapheresis patients also receive a number of other medications such as immunosuppressants for the prevention and treatment of graft rejection, antibiotics for prevention and treatment of infection and various other medications for related illnesses. The effects that plasmapheresis may have on removal of these medications is not known for many of these agents. This information would be helpful for the potential need to re-dose or give supplemental doses of medications. This is extremely important for the immunosuppressant medications since under-dosing of these agents may result in serious negative outcomes. Due to these many unknown aspects it would be useful to know the extent of drug removal during plasmapheresis treatments. This would enable more precise dosing and ultimately better patient care."

 Ziprasidone is a recently FDA approved antipsychotic, and it holds promise in the treatment of pediatric psychosis due to its low liability for weight gain and other side effects. This is important because early intervention in persons with a psychotic illness is important for their long-term treatment and outcome. Unfortunately, pediatric samples are often more sensitive to the side effects of psychotropic medications. Because psychotropic medications are often used by clinicians long before they are studied in pediatric populations, it is important to further study these agents.
 Twenty subjects with the diagnosis of a psychotic disorder, according to DSM-IV criteria, will be recruited for the study. If subjects have completed baseline evaluations, labs, EKG, and rating scales and are still eligible to participate, subjects will start on 20mg of
 Ziprasidone at night. The second week this will increase to 20 mg twice a day. At visits that occur at 2,4,6,and 8 weeks, the subject's dose of medication can be increased in 20mg per day increments. This allows for a maximum possible dose of 100mg. Dosage may be decreased at any time secondary to side effects.
 The potential benefits are that new information will be added to the field of pediatric psychiatry and the possibility that the medication may result in improved symptoms of psychosis. The potential benefits of this study outweigh the possible risks."

 The value of anaemia therapy with recombinant erythropoietin and iron for improvement of cardiovascular outcome has been clearly demonstrated in dialysis patients and is standard of care. In this patient collective one study shows that correction of anaemia together with blood pressure control does improve large artery function. After kidney transplantation, the situation is not clear. Anemia is common in kidney transplant patients despite a functioning graft and is caused by inadequate erythropoietin production, inflammatory reactions and toxic bone marrow depression. Current guidelines suggest to correct anemia also in kidney transplant recipients in analogy to hemodialysis patients, however, there is to date no evidence that correction of mild to moderate anemia will improve cardiovascular outcome.
 Since cardiovascular outcome studies are difficult to perform in renal transplant patients we propose to study intermediate endpoints, surrogate parameters of cardiovascular endpoints, i.e. large artery distensibility and endothelium-dependent brachial artery dilatation. Our group was able to show that the former is a valid marker of cardiovascular morbidity in renal transplant patients (1), and a recent report stated the same prognostic value for brachial artery flow-dependent dilatation in hemodialysis patients. Since the causes of anemia in renal transplant patients are complex, it is not clear that treatment of at anemia with recombinant erythropoietin and iron will be beneficial. Erythropoetin treatment is likely to improve hypoxia and thereby to improve large artery function, but also upregulates circulating endothelial progenitor cells, already elevated in kidney transplant patients and a marker of vascular stress, e.g. in patients with vasculitis. Erythropoietin might therefore be detrimental to endothelial function and as a consequence to vascular elasticity. It may be argued that in renal transplant patients, vascular damage is profound and irreversible and therefore vascular function does not respond to pharmacological interventions. However, our group was able to show that although renal transplant patients have severely impaired large artery functional wall properties independent of immunosuppressive treatment regimens (2), they have a preserved large artery vasodilator capacity (3) and that treatment with a statin produces sustained long-term improvements of endothelial function in kidney transplant patients (4). Previous studies showed effects of erythropoietin treatment on serological parameters of endothelial function in hemodialysis patients. It is important to relate erythropoietin-induced changes in these parameters to changes in large artery function.
 Particularly, in the aimed target population immunological processes are very likely to affect vascular function. It has been shown that endothelial cell proliferation is induced by angiogenetic factors released by activated monocytes. Besides monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells is triggered e.g. by endothelial cells themselves when they are exposed to shear stress(5). During the adhesion process different costimulatory factors become important in the early and critical atherogenetic event. Monocyte survival and activation do have a key role in this process leading to arteriosclerosis and endothelial damage(6). Changes in monocyte survival in dependence of immunosuppression or erythropoietin treatment may be responsible for increasing circulating endothelial cells(7). Therefore we aim to relate erythropoietin-induced changes in vascular function to changes in monocyte function and apoptosis. In many disease states changes in endothelial function are reflected by changes in urinary protein excretion. Therefore, erythropoietin therapy could alter urinary protein excretion in parallel to the changes observed in large artery function. Finally, anemia is more common in female renal transplant recipients than in male renal transplant recipients, and female dialysis patients tend to require more erythropoietin for anemia treatment that male patients. Therefore it is conceivable that gender differences exist with respect to the effects of anemia correction on vascular function. 1. Barenbrock, M., M. Kosch, E. Joster, K. Kisters, K. H. Rahn, and M.

 Individuals who use ST are at risk for developing heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure, and cancer. Other long-term effects include tooth abrasion, gum recession, and loss of bone in the jaw. Many individuals who use ST recognize the health risks associated with ST, but either do not want to quit or feel that it is impossible to quit. For these individuals, tobacco reduction may be an important transitional goal, either prior to quitting or as a treatment endpoint. The need exists for a program specifically aimed towards reducing, rather than quitting, tobacco use. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of nicotine gum at reducing ST use, as well as assessing the motivation to either quit or sustain lower levels of ST use.
 This 8-week study will enroll frequent users of ST. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either nicotine lozenge plus behavioral counseling or behavioral counseling alone.
 All participants will be asked to alternate use of their usual ST brand with nicotine lozenge or placebo in order to reduce nicotine intake by 50% during the first 4 weeks and by 75% the following 4 weeks. Participants will be required to maintain a daily tobacco use diary. Study visits will occur once a week. Tobacco levels will be monitored with urine tests, and questionnaires will be completed to assess tobacco use. Follow-up evaluations will occur 12 and 26 weeks following the end of treatment."

 Spit tobacco presents as many health risks to its users as smoking tobacco. Although a significant number of ST users recognize the importance of quitting, many either do not want to quit or feel it is impossible. For these individuals, tobacco reduction may be an important transitional goal, either prior to quitting or as a treatment endpoint. However, approaches to help ST users reach this goal have not been studied. This study will assess the effectiveness of using tobacco-free snuff in reducing levels of exposure to tobacco and associated toxicity, as well as enhancing motivation to either quit or sustain lower levels of nicotine intake.
 Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either treatment with tobacco-free snuff or treatment without it. All participants will be encouraged to reduce nicotine intake by 50% during the first four weeks and by 75% the following four weeks. Participants receiving the tobacco-free snuff will be asked to alternate the use of their usual brand of ST with tobacco-free snuff in order to achieve the targeted reduction. Participants not receiving the tobacco-free snuff will only be informed to try to cut down their tobacco use to the targeted reduction. Study visits will occur once weekly during the 8-week treatment period.
 Assessments will include vital signs, physiological measures related to tobacco use, and measures of motivation and self-efficacy to quit ST. The number of participants who either do not complete treatment, reduce nicotine intake, or quit completely will be assessed at the

 H. pylori infection has close associations with the development of peptic ulcer diseases as well as gastric cancer, gastric adenoma, and gastric MALT lymphoma. The association of the host genetics with the susceptibility to various gastroduodenal disorders has been intensively investigated in the pathogenesis of peptic ulcer and gastric cancer by H. pylori infection .
 In chronic active gastritis induced by H. pylori infection, activated neutrophils and mononuclear cells produce several pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines. In fact, levels of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines are elevated in gastric mucosa infected with H. pylori.
 Cytokine polymorphisms are associated with various inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.
 Recently, cytokine polymorphisms are considered to play an important role in the pathogenesis of peptic ulcer and gastric cancer. However, the roles of the IL-10 polymorphisms on the pathogenesis of H. pylori-related gastric cancer and peptic ulcer have not been fully elucidated.It is unclear whether pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines polymorphisms were associated with pathogenesis of peptic ulcer and gastric cancer in Japan.
 Then, we intended to clarify the association between polymorphisms of IL-10 and the susceptibility to gastric cancer, gastric ulcer and duodenal ulcer in Japan, and to detect the individuals who have higher risks for gastrointestinal disease development."

 Currently several strategies are under investigation to further improve adjuvant treatment of early node-positive breast cancer. These are combination treatment of drugs with synergistic mode of action, dose-dense application of cytotoxic drugs, dose-intensification and the use of new, non-cytotoxic approaches.
 In the recent AGO-study, a dose-dense and dose-intensified sequence of Epirubicin -
 Paclitaxel - Cyclophosphamide has shown superior efficacy compared to a conventionally dosed sequence of Epirubicin / Cyclophosphamid and Paclitaxel and was therefore chosen as standard treatment in this study.
 The experimental arm of EC-TX combines several of the above mentioned strategies: the combination of EC will be administered every 2 weeks as a dose-dense regimen, the combination of TX can also be considered as dose-dense due to the weekly application of paclitaxel.
 Furthermore there is clinical evidence, that a combination of capecitabine and Paclitaxel provide synergistic effects with improved tumour response. A randomized phase III study could demonstrate a survival benefit of a combination of capecitabine with Docetaxel in patients with metastatic breast cancer. This synergistic effect is probably based on the preclinical observed taxane-mediated up-regulation of thymidine phosphorylase in the tumour cell, which give drive to an increased transformation of capecitabine to its active form 5-Fluorouracil.
 Apart from this synergy, the EC-TX regimen includes now 4 highly active compounds for the treatment of breast cancer. The total doses of Epirubicin and Paclitaxel are identical in both arms. The dosage of Cyclophosphamide is lower in the experimental arm, which is preferred due to the induction of leukaemia at higher doses of Cyclophosphamide. The duration of both arms with 18 and 20 weeks is nearly similar.
 The 2 by 2 factorial design of the trial provides the additional possibility to explore the efficacy of a bisphosphonate as another strategy to further improve the prognosis of node positive breast cancer. As the mechanism of action of cytotoxic drugs and bisphosphonates appear to be independent the factorial design is an adequate statistical model for this trial. Up to now only limited information is available on the potential role of bisphosphonates in this setting and they have all been generated by using the 1st generation bisphosphonate Clodronate. 3rd generation bisphosphonates like ibandronate are much more active, less toxic and their application is more convenient (which is of high importance regarding the long duration of treatment).
 Primary aims of this trial are to improve disease-free survival by using the EC-TX regimen and by using ibandronate as adjuvant treatment for 2 years."

 Objective:
 We will use magnetoencephalography (MEG) alone, and in combination with EEG (MEG-EEG), to study the contribution of each method and their combination to the localizing yield of the non-invasive pre-surgical evaluation as compared to the invasive method. We will also correlate seizure origin and localizing data with surgical outcome, and, in retrospect, calculate the proportion of patients in whom invasive monitoring could have been avoided.
 Study Population:
 Participants in this study will be patients with medically refractory localization-related epilepsy who will be undergoing epilepsy surgery as part of their standard clinical care.
 Study Design/Methods:
 We will use a 275-channel whole-head MEG System (CTF Systems 2001 Inc). Patients will undergo a supine resting MEG-EEG recording prior to any surgical procedure. The resulting data will be integrated with the data obtained during the patient's standard pre-surgical evaluation, and compared with the invasive data obtained during chronic invasive monitoring (if clinically indicated), and/or intra-operative electrocorticography (all patients-standard of care). When analyzing the data, readers will be blinded to the results of the other modality (MEG vs. EEG, non-invasive vs. invasive).
 The patients will be followed in the outpatient clinic at 1-, 3-, 6- and 12-month intervals.
 Surgical outcomes will be graded according to the Engel and International League Against
 Epilepsy (ILAE) outcome scales.
 The findings from this protocol will not in themselves indicate or lead to epilepsy surgery.
 Outcomes:
 The primary outcome measure will be the proportion of seizure foci detected and delineated both non-invasively and invasively. The secondary outcome measures will be the proportion of patients with seizure foci co-localized invasively and non-invasively, the correlation of the obtained localizing data from both modalities with surgical outcome, and the correlation between the anatomical location of the epileptogenic zone and surgical outcome."

 SLOS is an inherited metabolic disorder characterized by moderate to severe mental retardation and congenital anomalies. SLOS is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase and the resulting defect in the conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to cholesterol. SLOS can now be reliably detected prenatally by analysis of amniotic fluid 7-8- dehydrocholesterol (7/8-DHC) levels. Unconjugated estriol (uE3) is one of the maternal serum analytes currently measured routinely to screen for Down syndrome. This analyte requires cholesterol as a precursor, and its concentration in maternal serum is lower when the fetus has SLOS.
 Currently, there is no national standard for the approach taken in prenatal screening; existing programs vary both in availability and in the protocol and algorithms used. The major barrier to identifying SLOS prenatally is the absence of sound screening methodology that takes into account the detection rate, the false positive rate, and the prevalence. This study will evaluate the efficacy of routinely identifying Smith-Lemli-Opitz Syndrome (SLOS) prenatally.
 The screening model in this study is based on data from SLOS pregnancies and will be tested in 1,000,000 pregnancies in which maternal serum uE3, alpha-fetoprotein, and human chorionic gonadotrophin measurements are being done as part of routine screening for Down syndrome. The screening false positive rate is projected to be 0.34%, the detection rate 62%, and the odds of being affected given a positive screening result 1:70. These rates all compare favorably with prenatal screening tests now in routine use. The study will also determine whether SLOS diagnostic studies can be carried out in maternal urine or serum, rather than amniotic fluid, thereby avoiding invasive procedures.
 Participants in this study will be pregnant women undergoing amnioscentisis during the second trimester. Women who have a positive test for SLOS will be asked to provide a urine and blood sample. The study will collect data on patient demographics and family history; data will also be obtained from the participant’s ultrasound, karyotype, alpha-fetoprotein, maternal serum screening, and SLOS reports. Three months after the pregnancy due date, a genetic counselor will contact the participant to obtain basic information about the baby’s delivery and health."

While poverty, poor health, stigma, and discrimination contribute to this poor quality of life, all these issues are interrelated and deserve further investigation. The quality of life for HIV-infected people may be made better through education, either for HIV-infected people to learn more about HIV, the treatments they are receiving, and how to deal with their disease, or for HIV uninfected people to understand HIV infection and to reduce stigma and discrimination associated with HIV infection. This study will provide skills training to HIV-infected adults and anti-stigma and anti-discrimination training to influential community members. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the changes in quality of life in HIV-infected villagers living in Anhui Province, China that result after these two training programs are administered.
 There will be 3 groups in this study. Group 1 participants will be HIV-infected villagers.

 Cardiovascular interventional procedures are minimally-invasive, catheter-based treatments such as coronary artery angioplasty and stenting. These procedures generally can be conducted on awake patients with few complications, and were developed as alternatives to conventional open surgery. Conventional cardiovascular interventional procedures are conducted by physicians manipulating medical devices inside patients under the guidance of fluoroscopic x-ray.
 We are developing minimally-invasive cardiovascular interventional procedures using real-time magnetic resonance imaging, also known as MR Fluoroscopy. These procedures have the advantage of excellent imaging without surgery and without radiation exposure or toxic contrast agents (dyes). Moreover, because MR Fluoroscopy can produce excellent images of soft tissue, blood, and of three-dimensional structures, it may be possible to guide minimally-invasive procedures not possible even with invasive surgery.
 The goal of this protocol is to develop and test incremental technical advances in patients."

 OBJECTIVES:
 -  Assess the distribution of IL13-PE38QQR following continuous infusion via catheter(s) into recurrent malignant glioma prior to surgical resection and a continuous infusion via catheter(s) into brain tissue adjacent to tumor resection site after surgical resection. 123I-HSA tracer will be used as a surrogate for study drug distribution.
 -  Determine the toxicities associated with administration of IL13-PE38QQR as described above.
 -  Assess the effect on distribution of IL13-PE38QQR of varying the catheter type (up to 3) and flow rate per catheter, keeping the total flow rates constant, for the pre- and post-resection infusions.
 OUTLINE: This is a pilot study to assess the distribution of IL13-PE38QQR delivered by intratumoral infusion prior to surgical resection and by interstitial infusion into tissue surrounding the resection site (peritumoral) after surgical resection. Prior to resection, catheters will be placed in the region of the solid contrast-enhancing tumor component. The volume of infusion, the duration of infusion, and the concentration of IL13-PE38QQR in the infusate will be fixed. For the post-resection infusion, catheters will be placed peritumorally into areas at greatest risk for residual or infiltrating tumor. The post-resection volume of infusion, the duration of infusion, and the concentration of
 IL13-PE38QQR in the infusate will be fixed. For the first 48 hours of each infusion,
 IL13-PE38QQR will be prepared with 123I-HSA tracer as the surrogate for distribution of study drug. The type and number of catheters utilized to deliver the pre- and post-surgery infusions will vary. To maintain a fixed total volume of infusate over 96 hours, the rate of infusion will vary depending upon the number of catheters utilized. Up to three different catheter types will be tested. However, only the same, single type of catheter will be utilized for the pre- and post-resection infusions for a given patient.
 To allow assessment of the distribution of the infused material, the first 48 hours of both the pre- and post-resection infusions will utilize 123I-HSA in the infusate. For the last 48 hours of both infusions, the 123I-HSA will be replaced by non-labeled HSA. The distribution of the 123I-HSA tracer will be measured by Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) scanning.
 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Up to 18 patients will be enrolled at a single site."

 A high percentage of women using progestin-only contraception experience breakthrough bleeding (BTB) and spotting that causes impaired lifestyle and results in decreased compliance with this contraceptive method. There is a need for an effective, low-cost, easily adapted treatment to reduce the bleeding and spotting in progestin-only contraceptives. The molecular environment of the endometrium of women with BTB and spotting contains abnormally high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta) and abnormally high levels of proteases (matrix metalloproteinases [MMPs] and neutrophil elastase), which prevent normal tissue repair. Doxycycline (DOX) is an inexpensive, FDA approved antibiotic that inhibits MMPs and reduces nitric oxide synthesis. This study will evaluate DOX treatment of progestin-only contraceptive induced BTB and spotting, characterize the endometrial molecular biologic changes that occur in DOX treated patients, and determine the effect of Norplant on sexual functioning and testosterone levels.
 All participants in this study will receive Norplant. Participants will then be randomized to receive either DOX (20 mg twice a day) or placebo for 6 months. Participants will have 9 study visits during the 24 weeks of the study. Study visits will include a medical history, physical exam, and blood and urine tests. Participants will also have three periodontal evaluations and three endometrial biopsies. At the end of the study, participants may choose to have the Norplant implant removed if they wish to discontinue Norplant use; otherwise the implant may remain in for up to 5 years."

 The long-range goal of this research is to develop a new and supplementary local treatment for osteoporosis to reduce the risk of fracture in susceptible individuals. PEMF is a noninvasive method to magnetically introduce a small amount of electrical current to a specific bone region to stimulate bone formation. PEMFs have been used for many years to treat nonunited fractures and enhance spine fusion healing and have been found to improve bone density in animal models of osteoporosis. Such a noninvasive intervention applied to the hip or spine, which are especially associated with high morbidity and mortality in aging individuals, could have a significant national health care impact.
 If effective for the treatment of bone loss, PEMF technology may be effective in treating osteoporosis. The primary objective of this pilot study is to determine the feasibility of using PEMFs to reverse or reduce bone loss that occurs with disuse of the forearm after fracture or surgery and to determine the effect of daily treatment duration on efficacy.
 Eighty patients who have recently undergone immobilization after hand surgery or after lower forearm fracture will be enrolled in this study. Participants will be randomized to either the PEMF group or a control group. PEMFs will be administered by means of a magnetic coil transducer placed over the treatment site for 1, 2, or 4 hrs/day for 8 weeks, beginning 6 weeks after the initial injury or surgery. A self-contained, battery-powered PEMF coil transducer already FDA-approved for fracture healing in the forearm will be used.
 Participants in the control group will receive inactive but otherwise identical units and treatment times. Measurements of bone density will be made using DEXA (dual energy x-ray absorptiometry) and pQCT (peripheral quantitative computer tomography) and compared to baseline. DEXA and pQCT provide planar and cross-sectional x-ray densitometry to determine forearm bone changes. Bone densities (global, cortical, and trabecular), bone cross-sectional structural geometry, and calculated strength index will be measured and compared to baseline values."

 Diabetic retinopathy is a disorder of major public health importance, accounting for the majority of visual loss among working age Americans. Diabetic macular edema (DME) is a manifestation of diabetic retinopathy that produces loss of central vision. Data from the
 Wisconsin Epidemiologic Study of Diabetic Retinopathy (WESDR) estimate that after 15 years of known diabetes, the prevalence of diabetic macular edema is approximately 20 percent in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM), 25 in patients with type 2 DM who are taking insulin, and 14 percent in patients with type 2 DM who do not take insulin. The Early
 Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) showed that moderate vision loss, defined as a doubling of the visual angle (e.g., 20/20 reduced to 20/40), can be reduced by 50 percent or more by focal/grid laser photocoagulation according to ETDRS protocol. Although several treatment modalities are currently under investigation, the only demonstrated means to reduce the risk of vision loss from diabetic macular edema are ETDRS laser photocoagulation, as demonstrated by the ETDRS, and intensive glycemic control, as demonstrated by the Diabetes
 Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) and the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS). In the DCCT, intensive glucose control reduced the risk of onset of diabetic macular edema by 23 percent compared with conventional treatment. Long-term follow-up of patients in the DCCT show a sustained effect of intensive glucose control, with a 58 percent risk reduction in the development of diabetic macular edema for the DCCT patients followed in the
 Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications Study.
 In brief, the study protocol involves the enrollment of patients >18 years of age who have
 DME involving or threatening the center of the macula and who have not had prior focal/grid laser photocoagulation for DME. These are patients for whom the standard of care would be to treat with laser photocoagulation. Eligible eyes will be randomly assigned to receive either the modified-ETDRS technique or the mild macular grid (MMG) technique. Outcome assessments will include Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), fundus photography, fluorescein angiography and standardized best-corrected visual acuity.
 The study consists of two phases: Phase 1 (the primary study), which consists of the first 12 months of follow up, during which a structured protocol is followed; and Phase 2, which consists of the second and third years of follow up, during which the management of DME can include techniques other than laser photocoagulation, at discretion of the investigator.
 During Phase 1, follow-up visits will occur at 15 weeks (3.5 months) +14 days, 34 weeks (8 months) + 28 days, and 52 weeks (12 months) + 28 days. The primary outcome for phase 1 is at 12 months.
 The primary study objectives of Phase 1 include:
 -  Develop standardized study procedures for future DME studies
 -  Obtain outcome data (e.g. changes in retinal thickness, area of retinal thickening, area of hard exudate, need for retreatment, onset of new areas of DME and changes in visual acuity) following use of the modified-ETDRS photocoagulation technique for patients with
 DME and various levels of retinopathy severity.
 -  Collect pilot data using the MMG technique to determine whether a subsequent large scale definitive trial should be conducted
 Phase 2 (2nd and 3rd years of follow up) is being conducted to collect data on, and generate hypotheses from, the long-term outcome of DME, irrespective of treatment received. Protocol visits will occur at 2 years + 8 weeks and 3 years + 8 weeks. During this phase of the study, therapies other than laser photocoagulation may be used to treat DME at the investigator's discretion. Because treatment other than photocoagulation will be allowed after one year,
 'pure' results regarding outcomes with each laser technique cannot be obtained in all groups, but will be available in a subset of patients. The data are being collected at relatively low cost and no risk over and above usual care. Therefore, the collection of potentially hypothesis-generating data from exploratory analysis is justified and could be important in designing future studies. Interpretation of the results of the above analyses will be complicated by the lack of a standardized protocol with regard to which patients receive treatment and what treatment is provided. Therefore, the results will be interpreted with caution.
 The phase 2 data collection may be useful for the following:
 -  Evaluation of retreatment rates in patients who responded to laser such that no additional treatment was required at 12 months. This is a long term analysis on a pure group of patients and will provide important information on the DME recurrence rate and need for retreatment in study eyes of those patients whose DME improved with either of the two protocol-specified treatments received in Phase 1 such that further treatment was not necessary at the 12-month visit.
 -  Provide long-term safety data for MMG. This is important due to the less well studied nature of MMG, especially over the long term.
 -  Provide long-term outcome data on current standard treatment (modified ETDRS laser) in today's patient populations to assist in powering future studies that will require at least 3 years of follow up.
 -  Provide data on outcome of intravitreal steroids in patients in whom laser treatment is not successful. For many patients who still have DME at 12 months, it is anticipated that intravitreal steroids will be administered. The continued follow up of these patients will provide an opportunity to explore the effect of the steroids on retinal thickness and visual acuity."

 Objective:
 In dysautonomias, altered functions of one or more components of the autonomic nervous system adversely affect health. Primary dysautonomias have been classified clinically into chronic autonomic failure (CAF) syndromes that include pure autonomic failure (PAF), multiple system atrophy (MSA), and Parkinson disease (PD) with autonomic failure (manifested especially by neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (OH)). Clinical assessment alone is often inadequate for correct diagnosis and does not provide insights into mechanisms or identify new therapeutic targets. This protocol calls for continuous development and assessment of physiological, neuropharmacologic, neurochemical, neuroimaging, and other clinical laboratory approaches, to identify lesion types and sites in CAF and improve diagnosis, increase mechanistic understanding, and incite novel therapeutics. PAF, MSA, and PD exemplify alpha synucleinopathies, in which deposits of the protein alpha-synuclein occur in Lewy bodies in catecholamine-producing neurons (PD, PAF) or in the cytoplasm of glial cells (MSA). Only the
 Lewy body forms of synucleinopathy are consistently associated with loss of catecholaminergic neurons. Under this protocol we have obtained evidence that patients with Lewy body diseases have decreased ability to take up intra-neuronal catecholamines from the cytoplasm into storage vesicles. Cytoplasmic catecholamines are cytotoxic, such as by enzyme-catalyzed conversion to highly reactive catecholaldehydes. By studying CAF patients we hope to make discoveries that will yield a unifying, integrative concept for the pathogenesis and different clinical manifestations of Lewy body diseases. Autonomic function testing under this protocol is also required for screening purposes for entry into other protocols of the
 Clinical Neurocardiology Section. Moreover, comprehensive autonomic function testing is requested in patients of the NIH Undiagnosed Diseases Program. Finally, in a long-term project as a member of the Autonomic Rare Diseases Clinical Research Consortium we are applying this testing to study the natural history of neurogenic OH.
 Study Population:
 The study population consists of patients with idiopathic, or primary, CAF, with emphasis on
 PAF, MSA, and PD. Comparison groups include healthy volunteers (HVs), patients with PD who do not have OH, and patients with iatrogenic CAF such as from bilateral thoracic sympathectomies.
 Design: Subjects undergo multiple physiological, neuropharmacologic, neurochemical, and neuroimaging, and other tests, to see if the results by different modalities agree and point to specific sites and types of lesions.
 Outcome Measures:
 Physiological outcome measures include hemodynamic responses to the Valsalva maneuver, orthostasis, and altered temperature at skin of the back. Neuropharmacologic measures include cardiovascular responses to test drugs that probe specific components of the autonomic nervous system. Neurochemical measures include plasma, cerebrospinal fluid, microdialysate, urine, and skin biopsy tissue levels of catecholamines and related compounds. Neuroimaging measures include positron emission tomographic scanning after injection of 18F-dopamine, 18F-DOPA, 13N-ammonia, or 11C-methylreboxetine."

 There are 34 million adolescents between the ages of 11 and 17 years old in the United
 States. Approximately 12% of them are African American. These youths experience earlier pubertal onset and face earlier challenges to participate in sexual activity, and therefore have earlier potential for pregnancy and contraction of sexually transmitted diseases.
 Experts in adolescent research have recommended developing and implementing new interventions to reduce early sexual activity; these interventions should target middle school-aged youths.
 The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the NIA intervention on intention to engage in early sexual behavior and actual involvement in early sexual behavior in a convenience sample of sixth and seventh grade African American girls.
 NIA is a Swahili word that means having a sense of purpose. It is one of the seven principles of Kwanzaa, a holiday that celebrates African Americans' cultural roots in Africa.
 The intervention was named after a self-development program for African American girls to highlight the intervention’s cultural basis.
 The study will provide 12 weekly and 5 booster after school didactic sessions; these sessions will teach health promotion and decision making skills to help girls successfully avoid situations where sexual activity is invited. Mothers and daughters will collaborate on homework assignments on puberty, heterosexual relationships, and sexual issues. The study will provide an evening mother-daughter workshop on sexual responsibility and a
 Baby-Think-It-Over weekend experience for girls using a computerized doll. Finally, the study will provide five Hey Baby! role-play vignettes to teach girls how to avoid heterosexual relationships that may lead to sexual activity.
 The NIA intervention will be compared against a usual after-school activity control group of sixth and seventh grade African American girls in two public middle schools in the Pittsburgh
 Public School system. Participants will be randomly assigned to either the NIA intervention group or the control group. Each participant will be in the study for 1 year. There will be a 12-week main intervention in the fall, a 5-week booster in the spring, and final testing 1 year after study entry. Assessments will be primarily paper and pencil tests of the study's main outcome variables: attitude toward early sexual behavior (ESB); subjective norms (mother, father, peer) toward ESB; intention to engage in ESB; and self-reported ESB.
 Additionally, there will be knowledge content quizzes after each main intervention or booster session and a written evaluation of the Baby-Think-It-Over weekend."

 DN-101 is an experimental drug that has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It is a newly formulated pill that contains high amounts of calcitriol, a naturally occurring hormone and the biologically active form of vitamin D. The natural vitamin D found in dairy products or in typical vitamin pills, must be chemically changed by the liver and kidney into calcitriol before it is biologically active. The body normally uses small amounts of calcitriol to regulate its blood calcium levels. However, for any possible therapeutic effect, MDS patients require much higher levels of calcitriol than the body can produce from dietary vitamin D. DN-101 provides MDS patients with high doses of calcitriol in a pill form.
 Laboratory studies have demonstrated evidence supporting the use of calcitriol in MDS. High dose calcitriol slows the growth of leukemic cells (cancerous cells) and increases the growth of normal bone marrow cells. Some patients with MDS may have low levels of calcitriol in their bone marrow.
 Clinical study results in patients with MDS have been mixed– some positive and some negative results. Elevated calcium in the blood occurred frequently and prevented the use of higher, more potentially therapeutic doses.
 Novacea tested a new formulation of calcitriol, DN-101, in a Phase 1 study. In that study the maximum tolerated dose of DN-101 that did not cause high blood calcium levels when given weekly for several months was determined. That dose is within the range that is potentially therapeutic for MDS patients and will be used in this MDS study.
 The purposes of this study are to determine if HDPA DN-101 treatment:
 -  increases the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets in the blood
 -  reduces the number of blood transfusions
 -  reduces the number of serious infections requiring antibiotics
 -  reduces the number of serious bleeding events
 -  improves fatigue"

 Fibromyalgia, a chronic musculoskeletal pain disorder of unknown etiology, is characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, and multiple tender points; the disease affects 3 to 6 million Americans. A person is considered to have fibromyalgia if he or she has widespread pain in combination with tenderness in at least 11 of 18 specific tender point sites.
 Treatment of fibromyalgia requires a comprehensive approach and includes aerobic exercise, heat and massage, antidepressant medications, and relaxation. Gabapentin, a medication used to treat seizures, has been shown to work on pain transmission pathways and may relieve the pain associated with fibromyalgia. This study will assess the efficacy of gabapentin in reducing pain severity in fibromyalgia as measured by the average pain item of the Brief Pain
 Inventory (BPI) score.
 Patients will be randomized to receive gabapentin or placebo. The gabapentin dose will be titrated for persisting symptoms and as tolerated during the first 6 weeks of the study, reaching final doses between 1800 mg/day and 2400 mg/day. Patients will then continue on the final dose for the remaining 6 weeks of the study. Following completion of the 12 week treatment phase, patients will be tapered off of the medication over 1 week.
 The effectiveness of gabapentin will be assessed using the BPI. The BPI is a self-administered questionnaire that measures the severity of pain and the interference of pain on function over the past 24 hours. Other assessments will include the total
 Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) score; six 11-point Likert-type scales in the FIQ that measure pain, fatigue, morning tiredness, stiffness, anxiety, and depression; the mean tender point pain threshold; Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-Severity); Patient

 Background:
 Veterans presenting for treatment of substance use disorders (SUDs) often have multiple and serious comorbid medical conditions that affect functional health status and health care costs. Prior studies show higher rates of medical follow-up when onsite primary health care was provided to patients with SUDs within an addictions clinic (onsite care). However, no data are available on differences between onsite versus referral models of primary care delivery in terms of clinical outcomes and total health care costs.
 Objectives:
 The objectives of this study are to compare patients with SUDs who receive onsite primary care in a VA outpatient addictions clinic to those referred for primary care to the general internal medicine clinic on: 1) medical outcomes and quality of life; 2) SUD treatment outcomes; and 3) overall health care costs. This information will assist in identifying practice guidelines for providing preventive services and treatment for acute and chronic medical conditions to individuals in SUD treatment.
 Methods:
 This study is a randomized clinical trial with two treatment conditions: 1) onsite primary care in the Addictions Treatment Center (ATC; experimental); or 2) referral primary care in the General Internal Medicine Clinic (GIMC; control). Subjects are assessed at baseline and at 3, 6, and 12-month time points. The sample includes 720 veterans, newly presenting or returning to SUD treatment, who exhibited a chronic medical condition at screening, did not have a primary care provider; and did not present with a serious medical condition requiring ongoing care in three or more organ systems. Medical status outcome measures include scores on the SF-36, and total emergency room visits and medical or surgical inpatient admissions.
 Substance abuse outcomes are measured by treatment retention, changes in Addiction Severity
 Index (ASI) scores, and self-reported alcohol use. Lastly, overall VA health care costs per subject per the 12-month period following randomization are compared across groups. The main analysis involves intent-to-treat analysis of group (onsite vs. referral) by time (3, 6, 12-month) using random effects regression models.
 Status:
 Complete. All subjects completed study interventions as of 3/31/2004. Currently data analysis is ongoing."

 Infants and toddlers who are placed into foster or adoptive care often exhibit a number of behavioral, emotional, and physiological problems. In the absence of specialized services, problems in the relationship between caregiver and child may develop; problems in the child's functioning often persist and are exacerbated. This study will attempt to alleviate the attachment and regulatory difficulties that affect many young children placed into care.
 Children are randomly assigned to either an experimental group or to a treatment control group for 3 years. The experimental group focuses on relational issues; the control group focuses on cognitive development. Caregivers receiving the relational intervention are trained to provide nurturing care, and to help children learn to develop adequate regulatory skills. Caregivers in the treatment control group receive training designed to enhance children's cognitive development. Caregivers in both groups will receive 10 home visits.
 Observations of children and parents are used to assess participants."

 Stroke is the third leading cause of death and the leading cause of adult disability in the
 United States. Each year, more than 750,000 Americans suffer a symptomatic stroke.
 Currently, tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) is the only approved treatment for acute ischemic stroke; however, its usefulness is limited because most patients cannot reach medical attention within the necessary 3-hour time window. In addition, rt-PA cannot be given in the field because it is contraindicated for treatment of patients with brain hemorrhage.
 The purpose of this multi-center, randomized, double-blind trial is to demonstrate that paramedic initiation of the neuroprotective agent magnesium sulfate in the field is an effective and safe treatment for acute stroke. This study will analyze magnesium sulfate, an experimental therapy for stroke, versus placebo among ambulance-transported patients with acute stroke. This trial will also demonstrate that paramedics can safely, effectively, and rapidly start neuroprotective therapies for stroke."

 This protocol describes a study to investigate the relationship between susceptibility to hypnosis and regulation of the autonomic nervous system. Several studies have demonstrated that individuals with particular conditions such as chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), chronic pain, and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), have altered hypnotic susceptibility. Patients with chronic orthostatic intolerance (COI), a general category of autonomic dysfunction that includes neurocardiogenic syncope (NCS) and postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS), often present with symptoms that are similar to those seen in CFS, PTSD, chronic pain, or GAD. These observations led to the hypothesis tested in this protocol that patients with COI may also have altered hypnotic susceptibility. We also hypothesize that increased hypnotic susceptibility will correlate with increased ability to modulate autonomic function appropriately in response to suggestions during hypnosis.
 The study population includes normal volunteers and patients with NCS or POTS. The design is blinded and correlative. Primary outcome measures are hypnotic susceptibility as measured by standardized scales; self-report inventory scores of psychobehavioral variables; physiologic parameters such as hemodynamics, sweating, skin electrical conductance, body temperature, respiratory rate, and bispectral analysis; and plasma catechol levels. The results of this study may lead to novel therapeutic strategies using hypnosis for COI."

 BACKGROUND:
 Heart failure (HF) is designated as an emerging epidemic. Yet, it is not fully characterized.
 Most data, derived from hospital discharges, cannot measure incidence, have uncertain validity and cannot capture the full burden of heart failure because of the shift towards outpatient care. Regarding its etiology, the respective role of hypertension and coronary heart disease (CHD) is controversial. Moreover, the prevalence of obesity and diabetes mellitus is increasing, both conditions linked to heart failure via several mechanisms such that their contribution to heart failure could conceivably be increasing but remains to be examined. Finally, while the existence of diastolic heart failure is recognized, its diagnosis is exclusionary based on symptoms of heart failure in the absence of left ventricular systolic dysfunction. This approach is unsatisfactory, thus the contribution of diastolic heart failure to heart failure remains contentious. These striking gaps in knowledge underscore the necessity of a rigorous investigation of the heart failure epidemic.
 Through surveillance of the Olmsted County community, previous studies have demonstrated the postponement of coronary heart disease towards older ages and the decline over time in the severity of hospitalized myocardial infarction and the incidence of heart failure after myocardial infarction. This implies that, if coronary heart disease is the main cause of heart failure, heart failure should be postponed towards older ages and its incidence rate relatively stable. During the same period, preliminary findings on heart failure surveillance suggest that the incidence of first clinical diagnosis of heart failure may not be increasing as much as implied by hospital discharges and that adverse trends may be occurring preferentially among younger ages. These data from the same community are challenging to reconcile with the concept of an ongoing major contribution of coronary heart disease to an epidemic of heart failure, thereby underscoring the need to rigorously study the epidemiology of heart failure.
 DESIGN NARRATIVE:
 The study has three specific aims and uses a community surveillance approach which is integrated with ongoing work on coronary heart disease surveillance to investigate the heart failure epidemic in Olmsted County by characterizing its magnitude and determinants and studying prospectively the contribution of diastolic heart failure. Aim 1 will estimate the secular trends in the incidence and in the outcome of validated heart failure to test the hypotheses that there has been an increase in the incidence of heart failure, which differs by age and sex and that the survival of heart failure improved while hospitalization for heart failure has increased. Aim 2 will use a case-control approach to characterize the etiology of heart failure and its changes over time and to test the hypotheses that coronary heart disease and hypertension confer an excess risk of heart failure, the magnitude of which is declining over time, that obesity and diabetes mellitus confer an excess risk of heart failure the magnitude of which is increasing and that the population attributable risk of coronary heart disease and hypertension for heart failure is declining, while that of obesity and diabetes mellitus is increasing over time. Aim 3 will prospectively characterize the contribution of diastolic heart failure to heart failure using brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) among persons with heart failure and define the prognostic value of BNP in all cases of heart failure."

 Hypertension affects 20% to 25% of adult population. Most patients are diagnosed as having essential or primary hypertension. Up to 10% to 15 % have an identifiable cause and many of those have an adrenal basis [Miroslava H. et al., 2002]. The tissue kallikrein-kinin (KKS) and renin-angiotension-aldosterone system (RAAS) had been implicated in regulating blood pressure and electrolyte homeostasis. Recent studies in humans indicate that the vasodilator tissue KKS, the counterpart of the tissue RAAS, is also expressed in the adrenal gland. The adrenal gland regulates sodium and water excretion and reabsorption through the release of aldosterone and corticosterone. Previous study reveals an anatomical linkage between the tissue KKS and sodium and water metabolism. Both of the KKS and RAAS may work coordinately to regulate salt metabolism, local blood flow. In contrast, although many investigators have supported the notion that Ang II and BK physiologically antagonize each other's effects on blood pressure, there are many instances where the two peptides exert common actions. For example, the Bradykinin also stimulates aldosterone release from adrenocortical cells through
 B2 receptors. Furthermore, the AT1 receptor and the bradykinin (B2) receptor form stable heterodimers, the two major signaling proteins triggered by AT1. In vitro studies (Margolius 1995) have shown that kallikrein acts as a prorenin-activating enzyme, and that tissue kallikrein can generate angiotensin II.
 However, the interactions between both systems are complex and not always simply antagonistic. The interactions of the two systems on aldosterone secretion are not examined
 Thus, we conducted this study to elucidate, first, whether some alterations in components of the kallikrein-kinin system could do effect on aldosterone secretion.
 Our study provides evidence that bradykinin contributes substantially to the aldosterone secretion with or without the effects of angiotensin. The data also could confirm whether
 ATR2-Bradykinin-B2-aldosterone really works. We want to realize the expression of angiotensin and bradykinin in the adrenal gland and hypertension related to these systems.
 Previous study has showed the post captopril plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC)/ plasma rennin activity (PRA) ration (ARR) was a reliable method for diagnosis of primary aldosteronism (PA). The ARR change by angiotensin II receptor blockade was reported to be significantly higher than that by ACE inhibitor. This study assessed whether angiotensin II receptor blockade offers any additional advantage in the diagnosis of PA. Clinically we evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of captopril (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition) and losartan (angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker) test in PA patient. This interaction mechanism, in term, could further explain the interaction of KKS and RAAS."

 The drug fenretinide is a retinoid that is similar to vitamin A. It is believed that fenretinide can cause cancer cells to die. SCH66336 is a drug that blocks farnesyl protein transferase (a substance needed by cancer cells to grow). It is believed that SCH66336 may selectively stop cancer cells from growing while not affecting normal cells.
 Both SCH66336 and fenretinide are taken orally and must be swallowed whole (i.e., the drugs may not be broken to make swallowing easier). Individuals who cannot take the study medications whole by mouth cannot enroll in this study.
 In this study participants will receive SCH66336 twice a day for each day of a 21-day cycle.
 Participants will also take fenretinide twice a day on Days 1-7 of the same cycle. Before beginning treatment, participants will have a complete physical exam, including measurement of height, weight, and vital signs. Participants will have blood and urine tests, a chest x-ray, and an ECG (heart function test). Females who are able to become pregnant must have a negative blood pregnancy test. In addition, all participants will have a neurological exam and will complete a questionnaire about their night vision. Some individuals may need an eye exam.
 Before beginning treatment, participants will have a biopsy of their tumor and will provide a sample of their buccal mucosa (inner cheek). In the biopsy, a sample of tumor tissue will be removed with a large needle. The buccal mucosa sample will be obtained by scraping the inside of the cheek. Participants will also have an extra blood sample (about 2 tablespoons) drawn.
 The tumor, buccal mucosa, and blood samples are all being obtained for research purposes only and will not directly benefit the participant.
 During the study, a physician will examine participants at least once a week for the first cycle of treatment. A treatment cycle is 3 weeks. Participants will also have weekly blood tests. After the first cycle of treatment, participants will have exams every 3 weeks. In addition, participants will have urine tests every 3 weeks, a neurological exam after the first 3 weeks and then as needed, and a chest x-ray every 3 weeks. Every 3 months, participants will complete a questionnaire about their night vision and will have an eye exam, if needed.
 While on this study, individuals will also participate in a pharmacokinetic study to measure the levels of the drugs in the blood. On the first day of treatment, the participant will have blood samples (about 1 teaspoon each) drawn before taking fenretinide and then 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, and 12 hours after taking fenretinide. The participant will not take the first dose of
 SCH66336 until after these blood samples have been taken. Additional blood samples (about 1 teaspoon each) will be taken at these same times on Day 7 of the first treatment cycle and on
 Day 1 of the second treatment cycle. A single blood sample (about 1 teaspoon) will be taken before taking the study drugs on Day 7 of treatment Cycles 3, 4, 5, and 6.
 Participants will have biopsies of their tumors, extra blood tests and will provide buccal mucosa samples on Days 7 and 21 of the first treatment cycle. These biopsies, cheek scrapings, and extra blood tests are for research purposes only and will not directly benefit the participant. Approximately two tablespoons of blood will be drawn during each of these extra blood tests. This blood, buccal mucosa (cheek), and tumor tissue will be studied to learn how the treatment drugs work in the body and what effects they have. Participants may remain on the study as long as they are responding to the SCH66336/fenretinide combination and as long as their physician feels it is of benefit.
 After completing treatment, participants will be contacted about every 3 months to check on the disease status. Participants will come to M.D. Anderson for clinical evaluations every 3 months for a period of 24 months.
 Fenretinide is in the form of capsules and SCH66336 is in the form of tablets. Participants will take the fenretinide capsules by mouth twice a day for seven days in a row at the start of each treatment cycle. Participants will take the SCH66336 tablets twice a day for 21 days in a row in each cycle. Participants will be given a pill diary in which they should record when they take the study medications and how many capsules and tablets they take.
 Participants will bring this diary and any unused medication when they return to the clinic for their check-ups. At the beginning of a treatment cycle, participants should take both drugs together at least 8 hours apart with either a high-fat meal or a glass of whole milk.
 Participants should continue taking the SCH66336 tablets at least 8 hours apart and with a meal or a glass of whole milk during Days 8-21 of each treatment cycle. Participants will not take fenretinide capsules during Days 8-21 of a treatment cycle.
 While on this study, participants may not drink grapefruit juice.
 This is an investigational study. The FDA has authorized the use of this drug combination in research but has not approved it for widespread use. About 40 individuals will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center."

 TKT029 is an open label multi-center study to assess the safety of enzyme replacement therapy with Replagal (agalsidase alfa) in children with Fabry disease, who have completed 6 months of agalsidase alfa therapy in study TKT023 (Cohort 1) or who are treatment-naïve (Cohort 2) and meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria of this study. The study will consist of every other week treatment with Replagal for 52 weeks, with periodic reassessments by Shire HGT for continuation of the study beyond 52 weeks. A decision on the part of the study sponsor to terminate the study may be made at any time.
 In Cohort 1, safety and clinical measurement assessments performed during Week 25 or 26 of
 Study TKT023 served as the baseline assessments for TKT029. Patients in Cohort 1 began treatment with Replagal manufactured using a roller bottle process (Replagal RB); this portion of treatment is denoted as Cohort 1, Phase 1. Safety evaluation visits for Cohort 1,
 Phase 1 were to be performed at Weeks 13, 25, 55, and every 26 weeks thereafter until the patient discontinued from the study or transitioned to treatment with Replagal manufactured using a bioreactor process (Replagal AF). The transition to Replagal AF marked the restart of the study clock and was denoted as Cohort 1, Phase 2. Safety evaluation visits for Cohort 1,
 Phase 2 will be performed at Weeks 1, 13, 25, 55, and every 26 weeks thereafter until the patient discontinues from or the sponsor terminates the study.

 OBJECTIVES:
 Primary
 -  Determine the maximum tolererated dose of arsenic trioxide when administered with imatinib mesylate in patients with accelerated or blastic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia or Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
 -  Determine the rate of complete morphologic remission in the bone marrow of patients treated with this regimen.
 OUTLINE: This is a phase I dose-escalation study of arsenic trioxide followed by a phase II study.
 -  Phase I:
 -  Induction therapy: Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate once daily on days 1-35 (weeks 1-5) and arsenic trioxide IV over 1-4 hours on days 1-5, 8-12, 15-19, and 22-26 (weeks 1-4).
 Patients undergo bone marrow evaluation on week 5. Patients achieving a morphologic remission proceed to consolidation therapy. Patients not achieving morphologic remission receive a second course of imatinib mesylate as above on weeks 6-10 and arsenic trioxide as above on weeks 6-9. Patients are re-evaluated on week 10. Patients achieving morphologic remission proceed to consolidation therapy. Patients not achieving a morphologic remission are removed from study.
 -  Consolidation therapy: Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate as in induction therapy on approximately weeks 6-11 (or weeks 11-16*) and arsenic trioxide IV over 1-4 hours on days 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, 12, 15, 17, 19, 22, 24, and 26 (approximately weeks 6-9 OR weeks 11-14*).

 Comparison After meeting the entry criteria, and the patient will be randomised to either early DC surgery (see below) or best current conventional management. Those randomised to surgery will have the operation done within 6 hours of randomisation. They will then return to the ICU and be managed thereafter in the same way as the conventional arm. Patients in the conventional arm will have all the usual therapies for increasing ICP optimised again. They then may have cooling to 35.0C or thiopentone bolus or thiopentone coma. These options are at the clinicians discretion. Late DC surgery in the control patients is discouraged however it may be done at the neurosurgeons discretion. These patients will be included in the intention to treat analysis.
 Surgical Technique The technique described by Polin will be used. The operation will comprise bi-frontal decompressive craniectomies with a single fronto-temporal bone flap extending across the midline. The temporalis muscles will be reflected inferiorly. Burr holes are located either side of the sagittal sinus at the posterior extent and bilaterally at the keyhole and at the root of the zygoma. This will create a large bifrontal craniectomy defect extending posteriorly to the coronal sutures. Bilateral large sub-temporal decompressions will be performed down to the skull base. The final bone cut is made along the supra-orbital ridges with an attempt to preserve the frontal sinus. Burr holes will be placed either side of the sagittal sinus inferiorly and the bone will be lifted out.
 The dura will be opened in one of two alternative ways: 1. The dura is opened with a cruciate incision bilaterally. OR 2. A large L shaped incision with the lower corner of the L facing laterally. The advantage to this method is that the cerebral veins are not disturbed medially by this incision.
 The dural opening should be covered with a dural or facial patch, so that the brain does not adhere to the scalp. Water tight dural closure is not necessarily aimed for. For patients receiving EVD monitoring, an ICP monitor with ventricular catheter (± optional PO2 and temperature monitor) may be placed prior to closure. Some patients will have been randomised to parenchymal catheter only. These patients will not have an EVD inserted.
 The bone flap is replaced once bone swelling has resolved and the patient has improved and left the intensive care unit (6-12 weeks). The bone flap is stored at minus 20o-70oC until reinsertion or it may be implanted in the subcutaneous tissue of the abdominal wall as an alternative."

 Chemotherapy is the current standard treatment for unresectable recurrent cervical carcinoma after radiotherapy or distant metastasis of cervical carcinoma. The most effective regimens are cisplatin-based chemotherapy. After failure of the cisplatin-based chemotherapy, there is still no treatment that has been proved to be effective.
 Human papilloma viruses (HPV) have been consistently implicated in causing cervical cancer especially those high-risk types (HPV 16,18,31,45) have been strongly associated with cervical cancer. HPV 16 was found in more than 50% of cervical cancer tissues. Results from many animal tumor models have indicated that immunization with tumor antigen-pulsed dendritic cells can trigger a long-lasting anti-tumor immune response and significantly inhibit the growth of implanted tumor cells. Recently, many clinical trials have been conducted to evaluate the feasibility and safety of immunizing cancer patients with tumor antigen-pulsed dendritic cells. No severe toxicity has been reported and some patients were shown to respond to the treatment. Based on previous animal and clinical studies by other investigators, we propose to evaluate the potential of immunizing cancer patients with antigen-pulsed autologous dendritic cells as a cancer vaccine to treat for recurrent cervical cancers after failure of cisplatin-based chemotherapy treatment or refusing chemotherapy. In this study, we will generate dendritic cells by culturing patient's autologous PBMC with GM-CSF and IL-4 in vitro. These dendritic cells will be pulsed with synthetic peptides representing the CTL epitopes on HPV Type 16 E7. Antigen-pulsed dendritic cells will be injected into inguinal lymph nodes under the guidance of real-time sonography. Each patient will receive four injections and 12 patients in total will be recruited for this study."

 The rates of asthma-related deaths and disease are disproportionately high among African
 Americans compared to Caucasians. Surveys indicate that middle- and upper-income Caucasians use more CAM than African Americans, but the therapies utilized are different. This study will determine how well people with persistent asthma adhere to their treatment and whether the type and frequency of use of CAM affects treatment adherence.
 Participants will begin this study by taking part in an interview about adherence to their current inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) regimen and their personal CAM use. After completing the interview, participant adherence to their ICS regimen will be monitored for 6 weeks.
 Depending on the type of ICS participants are taking, monitoring will be conducted either by participant self-reporting or electronic monitors that record the time and date of medication inhalation. Participant adherence will also be assessed at study completion."

 Epidemiological studies indicate that individuals with severe periodontal disease have significantly increased risk for cardiovascular disease. Periodontal disease, a chronic bacterial infection of the gums, is associated with recurrent bacteremia and a state of systemic inflammation that may convert endothelial cells to a pro-atherogenic phenotype with increased expression of inflammatory factors and loss of the anti-thrombotic, growth inhibitory, and vasodilator properties of the endothelium, including a decrease in the biological activity of nitric oxide. In human subjects, endothelial dysfunction has evolved into a well-accepted indicator of early atherosclerosis and predictor of increased cardiovascular disease risk. We have recently demonstrated a strong association between severe periodontal disease and endothelial vasomotor dysfunction in a case control study of otherwise healthy human subjects. In that study, periodontal disease was also associated with higher plasma levels of the acute phase reactant C-reactive protein (CRP). These results support the hypothesis that severe periodontal disease induces a state of systemic inflammation that impairs endothelial function, however, the cross-sectional design leaves open the possibility that confounding factors explain the results. We now propose to determine whether effective treatment of periodontal disease improves endothelial function (Aim 1) and reduces inflammation (Aim 2) in a randomized intervention study. Patients will receive comprehensive periodontal treatment designed to produce a state of periodontal health (scaling and root planing and periodontal surgery with re-treatment as needed) or routine oral hygiene and will be followed for 24 weeks. The study will examine endothelium-dependent brachial artery flow-mediated dilation, systemic markers of inflammation and endothelial activation (CRP, IL-6, myeloperoxidase, and ICAM-1), and oral markers of periodontitis (PGE2, myeloperoxidase, and pathogen DNA) before and after treatment. Compared to oral hygiene (which will stabilize, but not reverse periodontal disease), we hypothesize that comprehensive treatment of periodontal disease will improve endothelium-dependent dilation and reduce local and systemic inflammation. Further, we suggest that the degree of improvement in endothelial function will relate to the degree of reduction in specific markers of inflammation. Such results would provide much stronger evidence for causal links between periodontal disease, systemic inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction, a recognized surrogate for cardiovascular risk. The proposed studies will provide new insights into how periodontal disease contributes to cardiovascular disease risk in human subjects and may lead to new approaches to therapy."

 Two self-management strategies hold promise for improving the health of people with RA: ED (writing about stress, RA, and coping options) and CST (learning six pain and stress coping skills). A strategy integrating ED with CST may be more effective than either intervention alone. This study will compare the effectiveness of ED, CST, ED in combination with CST, and control groups in alleviating the symptoms of RA.
 This study will last until May 2009. Participants with RA will be randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups. Each participant will receive 3 writing sessions and 8 training sessions.
 Group 1 will receive ED writing followed by CST; Group 2 will receive ED writing followed by arthritis education; Group 3 will receive health behavior writing followed by CST; and Group 4 will receive health behavior writing followed by arthritis education.
 Participants will be evaluated at baseline and at Months 1, 4, and 12 for pain, physical disability, psychological impairment, and disease activity. In addition, participants will record daily diaries for 30 days regarding their pain, symptoms, coping, stress, and mood prior to each of the evaluations.

 The involvement of Substance P (SP) in depression and anxiety has been credibly demonstrated in a recent clinical trial. Although the precise physiological activation mechanism of the SP system is not yet known, the likelihood of exaggerated SP pathway activity in the pathogenesis of anxiety is supported in numerous animal studies that illustrate the anxiogenic, and anxiolytic effects of SP and SP antagonists (SPAs), respectively. Studies have further shown that SP release occurs in response to noxious, or aversive stimulation. SP stimulates NK1 receptors that then undergo endocytosis (i.e., internalization) resulting in a decrease in number of NK1 receptors on the cell surface. NK1 receptor quantification before, and after an aversive event, provides a dynamic measurement of SP neurotransmission.
 In this protocol, we will use a new PET ligand that has demonstrated ability to serve as an
 NK1 receptor antagonist, [18F]SPA-RQ ( [18F]-labeled Substance P Antagonist Receptor
 Quantifier). Using this tracer, we will: 1.) quantify NK1 binding parameters and determine the reliability and reproducibility of these measures in 10 healthy controls, 2.) we will look for regional differences in NK1 receptor binding in 10 patients with panic disorder (PD) versus 10 normal controls, and 3.) We will perform a single-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate NK1 receptor binding in PD patients and controls following either saline or doxapram infusion, which is a respiratory stimulant, in 20 patients with panic disorder (PD) versus 20 normal controls. Doxapram acts on both peripheral and medullary chemoreceptors to increase the rate and depth of breathing. It appears to be a potent and specific panicogenic agent, triggering panic attacks. The majority of PD patients, but not controls, are expected to experience a panic attack (aversive event) following the doxapram infusion. Comparison of pre-panic and post-panic NK1 receptor binding in PD patients will provide an estimate of SP release. The goal of the present study is to demonstrate the involvement of SP in panic disorder, and thereby, further our understanding of its role in the psychopathology of this illness."

 Background:
 -  Pox viral vectors can induce a PSA-specific T-cell responses and clinical responses in patients with advanced prostate cancer.
 -  Intratumoral vaccines of recombinant fowlpox vectors appear to be more potent in inducing antitumor effects than the s.c. route of administration, especially when the recombinant rF-vector given intratumorally is preceded by a rV-recombinant given s.c.
 This may be due to:
 -  Making the tumor cell an antigen presenting cell via upregulation of both antigen (signal 1) and costimulatory molecules (signal 2).
 -  Making the tumor cell more susceptible to killing via upregulation of ICAM.
 -  The increased expression of perforin in peptide-specific T cells that came into contact with the TRICOM-infected targets.
 -  Potentially allowing the immune system to select for other tumor encoded antigens to generate a polyvalent immune response.
 Objectives:
 -  1: Safety and feasibility of an intraprostatic vaccine strategy.
 -  2: To assess the change in PSA-specific T-cell response as measured by ELISPOT assay.
 -  2: To evaluate T-cell infiltration histologically in patients who have pre- and post-vaccine prostate biopsies.
 Eligibility:
 -  Must have either a) biopsy proven, locally recurrent prostate cancer following local radiation as defined by the ASTRO consensus criteria as 3 consecutively rising PSA levels or b) have refused or not be candidates for local definitive therapy (surgery or radiation therapy) and have clinically progressive disease on androgen deprivation therapy (eg. three increases in PSA over nadir, separated by at least one week). For patients with previous RT, the biopsy confirming local recurrence must be done at least 18 months after the completion of RT.
 -  Since this may also generate a systemic immune response, patients with minimal extraprostatic disease may be enrolled.
 -  Hepatic function: Bilirubin less than 1.5 mg/dl, AST and ALT less than 2.5 times upper limit of normal.
 Design:
 -  Dose escalation Phase I design. Each cohort will consist of 3-6 patients; maximum accrual is 30
 -  Patients in all cohorts receive initial priming with rV- PSA(L155)/TRICOM and rF-GM-CSF s.c.
 -  The first two cohorts utilize a booster intraprostatic with dose escalation of rF-PSA(L155)/TRICOM.
 -  Third and fourth cohorts add dose escalations of rF-GM-CSF along with the highest dose of rF-PSA(L155)/TRICOM.
 -  Last (5th) cohort utilizes booster intraprostatic vaccine (rF-PSA(L155)/TRICOM and rF-GM-CSF) with simultaneous identical booster vaccine given s.c."

NCT00089427,377504,2018-10-25T00:00:00Z,Clinical Trial Description,377504,AACT,"
 This is a Phase I clinical trial of experimental drug IL13-PE38QQR (Study Drug) in patients with newly diagnosed malignant glioma. IL13-PE38QQR is a tumor-targeting agent administered by a continuous infusion directly into the brain around the cavity where the tumor has been removed. Through previous research, this Study Drug has shown potential to control some of the recurrent malignant gliomas, such as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), anaplastic astrocytoma, and malignant mixed oligoastrocytoma.
 The Study Drug is made by combining a human protein (IL13) with a portion of a bacterial toxin protein, Pseudomonas Exotoxin (PE). The IL13 portion binds to receptors on the tumor like a key to a lock, allowing the PE portion to enter and kill those cells. Since tumor cells preferentially bind the drug, normal (healthy) brain cells are much less likely to be damaged by the drug.
 The Study Drug is delivered through tubing or catheters placed directly into the area surrounding the resection cavity. These catheters will be surgically placed within 14 days after the tumor has been removed. A pump is then used to slowly push the drug solution through the catheters using convection-enhanced delivery (CED) over a period of 4 days.
 Following treatment with IL13-PE38QQR, all patients will receive standard courses of radiation therapy. In addition, some patients will receive adjuvant temozolomide with radiation therapy and continue with temozolomide after radiation therapy is completed.
 Temozolomide is an anti-cancer drug that is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and sold for the treatment of recurrent GBM.
 This study will determine the maximum tolerated dose of IL13-PE38QQR when administered by CED after tumor resection and prior to radiation therapy with or without adjuvant temozolomide.
 Patients with newly diagnosed malignant glioma who have had a gross total resection of their tumor and who meet all other specified eligibility criteria may be entered into the study.
 Patients will be divided into 2 groups: 1. Stratum A - will receive treatment with IL13-PE38QQR followed by radiation therapy and 2. Stratum B - will receive treatment with IL13-PE38QQR followed by radiation therapy with adjuvant temozolomide. Treatment with temozolomide for Stratum B will continue after radiation therapy is completed.
 Subgroups (cohorts) of patients will be treated with up to 3 doses of IL13-PE38QQR. Cohorts of 3-6 patients will be treated at each dose level. Enrollment into each subsequent cohort will be dependent upon the safety and tolerability of treatment in the previous cohort.
 All patients will need to have histopathological confirmation of malignant glioma diagnosis from tissue sample obtained at the time of gross total resection within 14 days of stereotactic catheter placement. Each patient will have 2-4 standard microinfusion catheters placed and infusion of IL13-PE38QQR will begin within 24 hours of catheter placement. The infusion will last for 96 hours. Approximately 2 weeks after completion of infusion, imaging for radiation therapy planning, a physical examination, and neurological and laboratory assessments will be performed. Patients, if stable, will then receive standard fractionated external beam radiation therapy with a total dose between 5940-6100 cGy using 180 to 200 cGy per fraction.
 For those patients assigned to receive temozolomide in combination with radiation therapy, the dose of temozolomide will be administered on each day of radiation therapy and will be based on the patient's body surface area BSA at a dose of 75 mg/m²/day. After radiation therapy is completed and the follow-up MRI has revealed stable disease or a response, patients will continue temozolomide using repeat scheduled dosing at 150 -200 mg/m²/day for 5 consecutive days per 28 day cycle. Treatment cycles will continue for up to 12 cycles."

 Initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in the HIV infected population has been shown to dramatically reduce the morbidity and mortality of HIV infection through sustained reduction in HIV viral replication. However, such therapy does not cure HIV infection or prevent the spread of the virus. ART may, however, make HIV infected people less contagious by lowering plasma HIV-1 RNA levels, compared with people not on ART. This study seeks to determine whether initiating ART in ART-naive, HIV infected people can prevent the sexual transmission of HIV among HIV-discordant couples, as well as to demonstrate whether quality of life changes with the initiation of ART. Both opposite and same sex couples will be recruited at study sites in Brazil, India, Malawi, Thailand, the United States, and Zimbabwe for this study.
 Participating couples will be enrolled for approximately 78 months (6.5 years). Couples will be randomly assigned to one of two arms. HIV infected partners in Arm 1 will begin ART in addition to receiving HIV primary care. HIV infected partners in Arm 2 will receive HIV primary care. When the CD4 count in these participants reaches 200 to 250 cells/mm3, drops below 200 cells/mm3, or develops an AIDS-defining illness, they will initiate ART. All couples will receive HIV counseling and have their urine and blood collected at screening and enrollment, and at selected monthly, quarterly, and yearly intervals. They will be asked to periodically report information about their adherence to the ART regimen.
 Note: Per LoA#5, on the Data and Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) recommendation, as of May 10, 2011, all HIV-infected participants in Arm 2 who have not already initiated ART will be offered ART as soon as possible."

 BACKGROUND:
 Cholesterol is a major risk factor for coronary heart disease. The current approach to assessing this risk factor is to measure levels in the blood as if blood levels were a static and fixed phenomenon. Cholesterol levels in the blood are in fact a complex product of transport of cholesterol and lipids into and out of various compartments: (1) from the gut, liver or periphery into the blood; (2) from the blood into the periphery and the liver; (3) de novo synthesis of cholesterol in the liver; and (4) excretion from the liver as bile acids. It is possible that one or more of these processes may serve as better risk factors for atherosclerosis or coronary events than simple measures of cholesterol. This study addresses a new and potentially important question.
 The study will utilize plasma samples from subjects participating in Cycle 6 of the
 Framingham Offspring Study. The Framingham Offspring Study is a longitudinal community based study initiated in 1971. A sample of 5,135 men and women, consisting of the offspring of the original Framingham Heart Study and their spouses were enrolled for the study, the objective of which was to identify common factors or characteristics that contribute to cardiovascular disease (CVD) by following its incidence over a long period of time in a large group of participants who had not yet developed overt symptoms of CVD or suffered a heart attack or stroke.
 DESIGN NARRATIVE:
 The project includes a case-control study relating the new lipid findings to cardiovascular disease (CVD), a cross-sectional study to establish normal values and associations with diet and genotypes, and a prospective study of cardiovascular events during a 10-year follow-up period. The specific aims are to 1) quantify circulating indicators of cholesterol homeostasis [levels of phytosterols and cholestanol (surrogate measures of cholesterol absorption) and cholesterol precursors (surrogate measures of cholesterol synthetic rates)] in plasma samples from Framingham Offspring Study participants diagnosed with established CVD and/or >50% carotid stenosis (N=165) not taking lipid-lowering medication and control subjects matched for age, sex, body mass index, hypertension and smoking status (n=330); 2) evaluate the validity of using indicators of cholesterol homeostasis to predict CVD risk in the Framingham Offspring Study-Cycle 6 participants by a) establishing adult normal ranges for circulating levels of phytosterol, cholestanol and cholesterol precursor (N=3378), b) defining the relationship between phytosterol, cholestanol and cholesterol precursor levels, and lipid, lipoprotein and apolipoprotein levels in plasma, c) defining the relationship between phytosterol, cholestanol and cholesterol precursor levels and selected dietary intake data (energy, protein, fat, saturated, monounsaturated, polyunsaturated and trans fatty acids, cholesterol, fiber and antioxidant supplements) and d) determining the relationship between phytosterol, cholestanol and cholesterol precursor levels and selected genotype data related to CVD risk (gene loci of apo E, apo A-IV, scavenger receptor class B type 1 [SRB1], and ATP-binding cassette [ABC] G5 and ABCG8 transporters); and 3) monitor clinical events in the Framingham Offspring Study cohort throughout a 10-year period (1995-2005) and relate these data to the phytosterol, cholestanol and cholesterol precursor levels. Measures of cholesterol homeostasis will be quantified first in subjects identified in specific aim #1 and then the balance of subjects identified in specific aim #2, achievable now due to the development of a gas chromatographic method using a single plasma sample. These data will be assessed relative to dietary, biochemical and genotype data currently available for the cohort. The results of the study will define the relationship between markers of cholesterol absorption and synthesis, and CVD outcomes; establish reference values for measures of cholesterol absorption and synthesis; and assess the predictive value of these measures to identify high risk individuals relative to established risk factors."

 BACKGROUND:
 Metabolic syndrome, characterized by clustering of multiple metabolic abnormalities including abdominal obesity, dyslipidemia, hyperinsulinemia, hyperglycemia, and hypertension, is one of the most important risk factors for cardiovascular disease and stroke. Genetics play a significant role in determining the individual susceptibility to metabolic syndrome and the inter-individual variation in its associated phenotypes, though these genetic factors remain largely unknown. The long-term goal is to identify the metabolic syndrome susceptibility genes and their functional variants.
 DESIGN NARRATIVE:
 The goal of the research is to study the underlying phenotypic structure of the metabolic syndrome and to systematically search for genetic loci predisposing to the metabolic syndrome using the genome scan approach. The specific aims are: (1) to screen about 10,000 sibling pairs aged 40 to 64 years in Anqing, Anhui China, on intermediate phenotypes of the metabolic syndrome including body mass index, waist and hip circumference, serum lipid profiles (triglyceride, HDL-, LDL-, and total cholesterol), fasting serum glucose and insulin level, and blood pressure; (2) to study the underlying phenotypic structure of the metabolic syndrome in the about 10,000 ascertained sibling pairs using factor analysis; (3) to select and genome scan 800 nuclear families from the pool of the ascertained sibling pairs using
 Weber screening set 10 markers. Each selected nuclear family contains a proband and >=3 other family members. The values of the three most significant factors for metabolic syndrome in the factor analysis (see specific aim 2) will be used to classify proband status for each subject. A proband is defined as having >=2 out of 3 factor values falling into the same side of the 10/90 percentile tails of the corresponding age- and sex-adjusted population distributions; (4) to test for linkage in the genome-scanned families on intermediate phenotypes and factors of metabolic syndrome using the Unified Haseman-Elston method. In addition to the univariate test, linkage analysis will be performed using a novel multivariate version of the Unified H-E method, which has recently been proposed and shown to be significantly more powerful than the univariate test for traits with common genetic determinants; (5) to perform expansion or replication linkage studies on loci identified in the genome scan in 300-400 additional families with >=1 proband with a denser set of markers."

 OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients in the phase I portion of the study are stratified according to the number of successfully placed catheters (3 catheters vs 2 catheters). Patients in the phase II portion of the study are stratified according to time of recurrence of high-grade glioma (first vs second or greater) and by surgery extent (surgical resection vs stereotactic biopsy) for those with first recurrence only.
 -  Phase I: Patients undergo stereotactic biopsy or resection of the tumor followed by intratumoral (or tumor bed) catheter placement for treatment infusion. Within 12-48 hours after intratumoral (or tumor bed) catheter placement, patients receive TGFa-PE38 toxin (TP-38) intratumorally through 2 or 3 catheters over 33 to 124 hours. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
 Cohorts of 3-6 patients (in each stratum) receive escalating volumes until the maximum safe volume (MSV) is determined. Cohorts of 3-6 patients (in each stratum) receive escalating concentrations at the MSV until the maximum tolerated infusion concentration (MTIC) is determined. The MSV and MTIC are defined as the volume and concentration preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.
 -  Phase II: Patients receive treatment as in phase I at the MSV and MTIC.
 Phase I patients are followed post catheter placement, daily during TP-38 infusion, at 30 days, and then every 2 months for 1 year. Phase II patients will be followed for an additional year.
 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 6-105 patients (6-60 for phase I and 45 for phase II) will be accrued for this study."

 Fatigue is a commonly reported symptom in patients with end stage AIDS. Appropriate treatment can relieve suffering and improve quality of life. The role of progression of the disease, depression, anemia, and poor nutritional status in the development of fatigue is well recognized. However, the impact of micronutrient deficiencies has been minimally explored.
 AIDS patients are at risk for micronutrient deficiencies because of decreased caloric intake, increased metabolic requirements, and treatment with medications that can interfere with absorption, synthesis, and excretion. Patients with AIDS are particularly likely to be carnitine deficient.
 Levocarnitine (L-carnitine) is a micronutrient found in meat and dairy products that plays a major role in energy metabolism. Preliminary research has shown that patients with end stage
 AIDS experienced decreased levels of fatigue after L-carnitine supplementation. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of L-carnitine to treat patients with carnitine deficiency, fatigue, and AIDS.
 Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to receive either L-carnitine or placebo for 2 weeks. To reduce the possibility of side effects, the doses of L-carnitine and placebo will be titrated over 6 days to the desired study dose. After 2 weeks, participants receiving placebo will be switched over to receive L-carnitine. All participants will continue on
 L-carnitine for an additional 2 weeks."

 The investigators will offer a 10-week prevention program to help African American parents and caregivers (e.g., grandparents) diagnosed for the first time with Stages I, II, or III solid tumor cancer in the last 12 months who are caring for a 12-18 year old child at home who has been told about the parent's cancer diagnosis. Parents and their adolescent child(ren) will first be asked to complete a set of questionnaires that takes about 60 minutes and then will be told within 2 to 4 weeks whether they have been assigned to 1 of 2 programs that will get chosen by chance, like flipping a coin. Neither the families nor the researchers will choose what program is assigned. Both programs are designed to offer help coping with cancer. Both short- and long-term effects of the program will be evaluated.
 Program A involves just parents attending five educational sessions every other week (1 hour/session) with a group of parents who are also coping with cancer with specially trained group leaders. Adolescent children will not participate in these group sessions; this is the treatment as usual comparison group as most cancer centers do not meet with adolescent children who have parents diagnosed with cancer.
 Program B involves five group sessions (2 hours/session) every other week with other families like them that include adolescents in some of the sessions and parents and adolescents together in other sessions with specially trained group leaders.

 Detailed Description
 Rationale and Significance:
 Breast cancer is the most common cancer among Canadian women. Physical activity has emerged as a potential lifestyle factor for improving rehabilitation and survival after breast cancer. The American Cancer Society recommends that cancer survivors engage in at least 150 minutes of moderate-vigorous intensity physical activity per week. However, only ≈ 15% of breast cancer survivors reported meeting these physical activity guidelines. Therefore, interventions that promote physical activity behavior change in an unsupervised/home-based setting are needed to provide the necessary tools and support for breast cancer survivors. No study to date has assessed the effects of a lighter intensity physical activity intervention, compared to no additional physical activity prescription (control) or a higher intensity physical activity intervention (comparable to current exercise guidelines), in inactive breast cancer survivors, in addition to the longer-term maintenance effects of these interventions.
 Study Aims:
 Aim 1: To evaluate the effects of prescribing an additional 300 minutes/week of lighter intensity physical activity (LIPA) or 150 minutes/week of higher intensity physical activity (HIPA) versus no physical activity intervention (control) on total physical activity and sedentary time in inactive breast cancer survivors.
 Aim 2: To evaluate the effects of prescribing an additional 300 minutes/week of LIPA or 150 minutes/week of HIPA versus control on markers of health-related fitness (anthropometric measures, body composition, cardio-respiratory fitness) and patient reported outcomes (quality of life, sleep quality, feelings of happiness, perceived feelings of depression) in inactive breast cancer survivors.
 Aim 3: To evaluate the longer-term (24-week) maintenance effect of prescribing an additional 300 minutes/week of LIPA or 150 minutes/week of HIPA versus control on our primary and secondary outcomes.
 Research Plan:
 A three-armed, 12-week pilot randomized controlled trial followed by a 12-week follow-up measurement is proposed. All eligible and interested women are invited to contact and meet with study staff at the Holy Cross Center in Calgary, at which time the study protocol is explained, informed consent obtained and baseline questionnaires distributed. These questionnaires assess: demographic characteristics, sleep quality, perceived health-related quality of life, feelings of happiness and perceived feelings of depression. At the end of this first meeting, participants are asked to wear an Actigraph GTX3® accelerometer for seven days to assess baseline physical activity levels. During a second meeting at the Holy Cross
 Center, accelerometers are returned to study staff, anthropometric data (height, weight, waist and hip circumferences and body composition) are collected and a maximal treadmill test (modified Balke protocol) is conducted. Participants are then randomized, using a 1:1:1 allocation, into either the control (no intervention), lighter intensity or the higher intensity physical activity interventions. The control group is instructed to maintain baseline physical activity participation. The lighter intensity physical activity (LIPA) group is instructed to accumulate 300 minutes/week of physical activity at an intensity of 40-60% of heart rate reserve. The higher intensity physical activity (HIPA) group is instructed to accumulate 150 minutes of physical activity at an intensity of 60-80% of heart rate reserve. Participants randomized to the LIPA and HIPA groups are given: 1) instructions on physical activity safety and goal setting, proper heart rate monitoring and stretching techniques that should be completed before and after physical activity participation; 2) a publicly-available physical activity guidebook for breast cancer survivors; 3) a Polar A360® device to track heart rate and physical activity time throughout the intervention. Data collected by this device are uploaded to the Polar Flow® application by syncing with a smart phone or a computer with a provided USB cord. Participants are asked to upload their data at least once per week. If a participant does not own a computer or a smart phone, or prefers that the study staff upload these data for them, in-person meetings are arranged to do so.
 Participants in the LIPA and HIPA groups are also asked to rate the feasibility of achieving the prescribed physical activity targets and record strategies used and barriers encountered during the intervention in a diary. In-person/telephone meetings with these participants occur every three weeks to review data from the Polar A360® device and diary, to reinforce progress/good adherence and discuss/solve any problems or barriers to achieving the prescribed physical activity goals. During weeks 12 (final intervention week) and 24 (final week of the follow-up period), all participants wear an Actigraph GTX3® accelerometer to assess physical activity volume. At the end of weeks 12 (end of the intervention) and 24 (end of the follow-up period), all participants repeat baseline measurements and questionnaires, except for items on demographic characteristics.
 The investigators will use intention-to-treat statistical analysis on all participants with follow-up data regardless of adherence to the interventions. An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be used to compare between-group differences in study outcomes at 12- and 24-weeks, compared to baseline, after adjusting for baseline outcomes values.
 This pilot randomized controlled trial will provide data on the feasibility of prescribing different physical activity intensities within a home-based setting to increase total physical activity time, reduce sedentary time and improve health outcomes in breast cancer survivors. The investigators will use these data to help design and conceptualize a larger-scale randomized controlled trial."

 Study subjects will be exposed to enrofloxacin at a concentration level representative for occupational exposure of yardmen at poultry farms.
 As three uptake-routes, oral, inhalation and dermal, are conceivable all three cases will be investigated. After administration blood and urine samples will be analysed for enrofloxacin and its main metabolite ciprofloxacin at several time points. The objective of this exemplarily study is to obtain information on the pharmacokinetics of the different uptake routes. If different exposure routes are characterized by different pharmacokinetics, such studies can be used to obtain a better understanding of general routes of exposure in occupational environments. On the basis of the results mitigation strategies can be developed, reducing the risk of exposure."

 Intake of carbohydrate-rich foods transiently increases blood glucose levels (known as postprandial glycaemia). Repeated, high, postprandial glucose responses are evidenced to impair pancreatic beta cell function, thus increasing the risk of developing type-2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease. Therefore, meals that elicit a reduced, or more gradual, rise in blood glucose levels are desirable.
 Previous studies have shown that consuming a drink containing fruit polyphenols, such as those from blackcurrants (BC), immediately before a high carbohydrate meal, reduced the postprandial glycaemic response. Importantly, other fruit components, namely soluble fibres, also impact on carbohydrate digestion by slowing gastric emptying rates. It is not yet known the effect of combining fibre and polyphenols on postprandial glycaemia. Although limited, there is a growing body of evidence showing beneficial acute effects of polyphenols in cognitive function which is of great interest in many work and academic environments where fast cognitive enhancement is wanted to perform a task or an exam.
 This study will investigate the effects of drinks containing BC polyphenol extract combined with pulp (source of fibre), and pulp alone, on postprandial outcomes and cognitive function following a mixed carbohydrate (starch and sucrose) test meal.
 Study design: A randomised, controlled, double-blind, cross-over study, of the healthy adult
 UK population, will be conducted. All subjects will receive the placebo drink, pulp only drink and the pulp with polyphenol drink in a random order. Baseline (fasted) blood samples will be taken before consuming the test drink (T0 min). Immediately following consumption of the drink, a mixed carbohydrate test meal will be consumed. Further blood samples will be collected at regular times until T150 min. Blood samples will be analysed for plasma glucose, insulin, glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) and C-peptide. Subjects will also perform a 30 min computer based cognitive performance test at baseline (T-45 min) and endpoint (T165 min). Visual analogue scales will be used to assess the effect of the test drinks on a range of sensory characteristics e.g. palatability, satiety and subjective mood feelings. Finally, an ad libitum pasta meal at the end of the study visit (T 215 min) will be used to assess the effects on energy intake."

 The treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus infection has dramatically advanced in recent years, with the availability of multiple interferon-free treatment regimens that result in cure in over 95% of treatment naïve individuals with 8 -12 weeks of therapy. Despite these advances, however, the natural history and treatment of HCV remains undefined in several populations, including pregnancy. In particular, rates of vertical (mother to child) transmission, perinatal and neonatal morbidity, assessment of disease severity (fibrosis) in pregnancy and timing of treatment are not well understood.
 At least 2.3 million people in the United States and 185 million people worldwide are believed to have chronic HCV infection, although as it is frequently asymptomatic until the development of end-stage liver disease (ESLD), this may be a significant underestimate.
 Between 2012 and 2014 the HCV detection rate among women of childbearing age increased by 22% nationally and over 200% in Kentucky, while the proportion of children born to HCV infected women increased 68% nationally and 128% in Kentucky.
 Currently, in the United States, the overall rate of children born to HCV infected women is 3.4 per 1,000 live births, with the highest rate in West Virginia, with 22.4 per 1,000 live births occurring to HCV-infected women. Overall, the number of HCV infected reproductive age women has doubled from 2006 to 2014, with an estimated 29,000 HCV infected women giving birth and 1,700 infants vertically infected each year, according to previous estimates of vertical transmission.The true incidence of vertical transmission of HCV is unknown, although the most commonly cited meta-analysis reported a mean transmission rate of 5.8% in HIV-negative women and 10.8% in HIV-positive women.
 The timing of vertical transmission is also not well characterized. There is limited data regarding the course of chronic hepatitis C during pregnancy, HCV viral loads appear to peak during third trimester. Both utero and peripartum transmission appear possible, while breastfeeding does not appear to be a risk factor. It appears that between 80 and 90% of children who acquire hepatitis C via vertical transmission will develop chronic infection.
 However, as sequelae of infection are not commonly observed in childhood, and appropriate testing of exposed children is poor, this may not be a true reflection of actual prevalence.
 The current AASLD/IDSA HCV Guidelines recommend all children born to HCV infected women be tested, but they do not specify when or in what manner.
 Maternal HCV infection has been shown to contribute to worsened perinatal and neonatal outcomes in the absence of vertical transmission. It is associated with increased rates of intrauterine fetal death, preterm delivery, low birth rate, increased risk for adverse neonatal neurological outcomes, increased infant feeding difficulties and subsequent maternal infertility.
 Although there is sufficient time between the end of the first trimester and delivery to provide curative therapy during pregnancy, no safety studies in pregnancy have been done.
 Therefore, this study will offer curative DAA therapy to HCV infected Moms with the fixed dose combination of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir (SOF/VEL) after the cessation of breastfeeding.
 This combination of sofosbuvir, a nucleotide inhibitor of the NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and velpatasvir, an inhibitor of the NS5A transcriptional activator, is approved for the treatment of chronic HCV infection due to genotypes 1 through 6.
 Given the gaps in the investigator's understanding of HCV vertical transmission rates,
 HCV-associated perinatal complications, and marked increases in both the number of women with chronic HCV infection giving birth and the number of children under two years old testing positive for HCV, this study will help to both better characterize the natural history of HCV in pregnancy and ultimately, to facilitate its elimination when women are screened for chronic HCV as part of routine gynecologic care and are offered curative therapy prior to conception (or as part of prenatal care and when dosing during pregnancy can be safely undertaken).
 All participants will be offered curative therapy with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir (Epclusa ®) after delivery and the cessation of breastfeeding. Subjects may be enrolled at any time after conception up through 36 weeks gestation. The management of subjects in pregnancy will be in accordance with ACOG guidelines and individual clinical judgment, however testing will include, but not be limited to, testing for HCV infection, HIV infection, HBV infection, HSV infection, group B Streptococcal colonization, HCV genotype, HCV viral load, as well as assessment of hepatic and renal function. Staging of hepatic fibrosis must be performed within 12 months prior to initiation of SOF/VEL. Acceptable methods of staging include transient elastography or liver biopsy. If elastography is performed, it must be performed either prior to pregnancy or at least 12 weeks following delivery, due to pregnancy-related changes in hepatic stiffness. Subjects will be followed on a schedule that is determined by their obstetric care providers throughout their pregnancy. Data from clinical and laboratory records regarding the participants pregnancy and delivery, and their infant's medical record from the infant's pediatrician from birth to 12 months of age will be collected. Following delivery, infants will be evaluated at 12, 24 and 48 weeks of age, with testing for HCV RNA to be obtained at each evaluation. Vertical transmission is defined as two positive HCV RNA
 PCR tests, at least one before the 48 week visit, and again at the 12-month follow-up infant visit.At 24 weeks following delivery, participants will begin therapy with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir (SOF/VEL) once daily for 12 weeks. Therapy will not be initiated until cessation of breastfeeding. Participants will be evaluated at the initiation of SOF/VEL therapy, at 4 and 8 weeks after starting therapy, as well as 12 weeks following completion of therapy for determination of SVR-12. Quantitative measurement of HCV RNA will be obtained at each visit, as well as evaluation of renal and hepatic function."

 This study investigates the effects of high dosage task and impairment based training of the hemiparetic hand, using haptic robots integrated with complex gaming and virtual reality simulations on recovery and function of the hand, when the training is initiated within early period of heightened plasticity. The intervention uses two training systems. NJIT-RAVR consists of a data glove combined with the Haptic Master robot that provides tracking of movements in a 3D workspace and enables programmable haptic effects, such as variable anti-gravity support, springs and dampers, and various haptic objects. The NJIT-TrackGlove consists of a robotic hand exoskeleton to provide haptic effects or assistance and an instrumented glove for finger angle tracking, and an arm tracking system to track hand and arm position and orientation. Using programmable software and custom bracing we enable use of this system for patients with a broad set of impairments and functional abilities. A library of custom-designed impairment and task-based simulations that train arm transport and hand manipulation, together or separately will be used. Pilot data show that it is possible to integrate intensive, high-dosage, targeted hand therapy into the routine of an acute rehabilitation setting. The study integrates the behavioral, the kinematic/kinetic and neurophysiological aspects of recovery to determine: 1) whether early intensive training focusing on the hand will result in a more functional hemiparetic arm; (2) whether it is necessary to initiate intensive hand therapy during the very early inpatient rehabilitation phase or will comparable outcomes be achieved if the therapy is initiated right after discharge, in the outpatient period; and 3) whether the effect of the early intervention observed at 6 months post stroke can be predicted by the cortical reorganization evaluated immediately prior to the therapy. This study will fill critical gaps in the literature and make a significant advancement in the investigation of putative interventions for recovery of hand function in patients post-stroke."

 Introduction In the last 10 years, numerous published cases and case series described the revascularization or regenerative endodontics. Revascularization is a conservative method for inducing maturogenesis in necrotic immature teeth. The favorable outcomes of regenerative endodontics are largely dependent on the adequate disinfection of the root canal. These canals with compromised fragile underdeveloped dentinal walls represent a contraindication for mechanical instrumentation; thus, chemical debridement remains the main form of disinfection. A mixture of ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, and minocycline, known as the triple antibiotic paste (TAP), has been shown to be very effective in eliminating endodontic pathogens in vitro and in situ. However, TAP has an adverse effect on stem cell survival.
 Discoloration of the tooth is a problem mostly related to the use of minocycline in TAP.
 Moreover, TAP can demineralize dentin resulting in reduced microhardness and fracture resistance. Propolis, a flavonoid-rich resinous product of honeybees, is ten times less cytotoxic than calcium hydroxide and has a well-known antibacterial effect. Therefore, creating alternatives to the TAP for disinfecting the root canal of necrotic teeth during the process of pulp revascularization is thought to be of value.
 Materials and methods Forty patients with immature, nonvital maxillary incisors were included in this study from the outpatient clinic of the Faculty of Dentistry, Ain Shams University,
 Cairo, Egypt. A detailed medical and dental history was obtained from each patient's parents or guardians. Only medically free patients were included in this research. The clinical and radiographic exclusion criteria were teeth with vertical fractures, periodontally involved teeth, and nonrestorable teeth. All procedures were performed after obtaining proper institutional review board approval based on the regulations of the Ethical Committee of the
 Faculty of Dentistry, Ain Shams University. Intraoral periapical radiographs revealed immature apices. The age of the patients ranged between 8 and 18 years. Informed consent was signed for each case by the patient's parents or guardians including the proposed treatment and possible outcomes or complications.
 Cases were divided randomly and equally into 4 groups according to the intracanal medicament (10 patients for each group):
 TAP group: was treated with Triple Antibiotic Paste CP group: was treated with Ciprofloxacin
 + Propolis paste CM group: was treated with Ciprofloxacin + Metronidazole paste PM group: was treated with Propolis + Metronidazole paste 1. Triple Antibiotic Paste (TAP):
 It consisted of Ciprofloxacin (Ciprocin 250 mg tablets; EPICO, Cairo, Egypt),
 Metronidazole (Flagyl 500 mg tablets; Sanofi Aventis Pharma, Cairo, Egypt), Doxycycline (Vibramycin 100 mg capsules; Pfizer, Cairo, Egypt). One Doxycycline capsule content was evacuated in a sterile mortar, one tablet of metronidazole and one tablet of ciprofloxacin were crushed and ground in the same mortar using a pestle into homogenous powder. Saline drops (Otrivin baby saline; Novartis, Cairo, Egypt) were added and mixed using the pestle until a creamy paste was achieved. 2. Ciprofloxacin + Propolis Paste:
 Ethanol extract of raw propolis (EEP; ElEzaby Co. Labs, Cairo, Egypt.) was prepared by adding 10 gm of propolis (Imtinan, Cairo, Egypt) to 40 gm of 70% ethanol (ElGomhorya
 Co., Cairo, Egypt) (for 20% tincture) in a dark container to prevent reduction of propolis. The container was sealed and placed at room temperature for a period of three weeks. The sealed container was manually shaken every 2 days to ensure proper mixing.
 After 3 weeks, the container was opened and ethanol extract of propolis was obtained.
 Ethanol-free EEP was made by evaporating the ethanol in a water bath. EEP was then mixed with Ciprofloxacin powder in the ratio 1:1. Saline drops were added and mixed using the pestle until a creamy paste was achieved. 3. Ciprofloxacin + Metronidazole Paste:
 Ciprofloxacin powder was mixed with Metronidazole powder in the ratio 1:1. Saline drops were added and mixed using the pestle until a creamy paste was achieved. 4) Propolis + Metronidazole paste: EEP was mixed with Metronidazole powder in the ratio 1:1.
 Saline drops were added and mixed using the pestle until a creamy paste was achieved.
 A preoperative radiograph was taken using the standardized paralleling technique by the Rinn
 XCP (Rinn Corporation Elgin, Illinois, USA) alignment system and Fona ScaNeo intra-oral digital imaging system (FONA Dental, Bratislava, Slovak Republic). Patients were treated as follows: Caries was excavated; access cavity was prepared. The rubber dam was then applied and working length was determined with a periapical radiograph taken with a file inserted into the canal. Canal space was debrided using K file size #80. Canal space was irrigated using 40 cc of NaOCl 2.6% solution and final flush of saline. Canal space was dried using paper points. The antibiotic paste was prepared as previously described. One cc of the prepared paste was injected into the canals using a sterile plastic syringe with 20 gauge needle. Care was taken to avoid apical extrusion and to minimize placement in the coronal portion of the tooth. The access cavity was then sealed using temporary restoration (Coltosol
 F; Coltene Whaledent, Altstatten, Switzerland) over plain cotton. After the 3 weeks, under the same aseptic conditions, anesthesia without vasoconstrictor (Mepecaine, Alexandria Co.,
 Alexandria, Egypt) was administrated. The tooth was re-entered, the antibiotic paste was removed and the canal was irrigated using a sterile saline and dried using paper points.
 Sterile hand file size #25 was introduced into the root canal and placed at 2 mm beyond the working length to induce bleeding into the canal. The bleeding was allowed to reach a 3-mm level below the cemento-enamel junction, and teeth were left at rest for 5 minutes so that a blood clot could be formed. Next, a 3-mm plug of MTA (Angelus; Londrina, Brazil) was inserted into the canals using a suitable-sized amalgam carrier to seal the root canal at the cervical level. The MTA plug was verified radiographically. The MTA plug was then covered by moist cotton and temporary filling. After one week, MTA setting was confirmed clinically, adhesive composite resin (Z250 Restorative; 3M ESPE, St Paul, Minnesota, USA) was used to seal the access cavity.
 Evaluation:
 Patients were recalled for follow up at 3, 6, 9, 12, and 18 months. Follow-up included the clinical assessment of pain and/or swelling and standardized radiographic assessment, which included the following: 1. An increase in root length 2. An increase in root thickness 3. A decrease in apical diameter 4. A change in periapical bone density All radiographic measures were collected by the same investigator. All radiographic measurements were repeated after 1 week, and the mean of the 2 sets was considered as the final value.
 Increase in root length: A measuring scale was set in the Image-J software (Image-J v1.44, US
 National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) by measuring a known clinical dimension to its radiographic dimension. The scale was calculated as number of measured pixels per mm length.
 Root length was measured as a straight line from the cemento- enamel junction to the radiographic apex of the tooth in millimeters. Pre and follow-up root lengths were measured using Image-J analysis software. Difference in length was calculated. Percentage of increase in length was calculated as follows: percentage of increase in length = [(postoperative length - preoperative length) / preoperative length] X 100.
 Increase in root thickness: Using the preset measurement scale, the level of the apical third was determined and fixed from the cemento-enamel junction. The root thickness and the pulp width were measured mesiodistally at this level in millimeters. Mesiodistal dentin thickness was measured by subtraction of the pulp space from the whole root thickness. Pre and follow-up root thicknesses were measured. Measurements were done pre and post operatively at the same fixed level. Difference in dentin thickness was calculated. Percentage of increase in dentin thickness was calculated as follows: percentage of increase in dentin thickness =
 [(postoperative thickness - preoperative thickness) / preoperative thickness] X 100.
 Decrease in apical diameter: Using the preset measurement scale, the mesiodistal diameter of the apical foramen was measured in millimeters. Measurements were done pre and postoperatively. Percentage of apical closure was calculated as follows: percentage of apical closure = [(preoperative apical diameter - postoperative apical diameter) / preoperative apical diameter] X 100.
 Periapical bone density:
 Periapical bone density was estimated using Image-J software as follows: periapical area was located and analyzed for bone density. Average area density was measured in scale from 0 (black) to 255 (white) and recorded for each radiograph. The same area was then measured in subsequent radiographs and average densities were recorded for the follow up radiographs. The difference between densities was calculated between subsequent radiographs. Percentage of change in density was calculated from the original pre-operative radiograph density as follows: percentage of change in density = [(postoperative bone density - preoperative bone density)/preoperative bone density] X 100.
 Data were collected, tabulated and statistically analyzed using statistical analysis software
 SPSS (Statistical Packages for the Social Sciences 19.0, IBM, Armonk, NY). Two-way analysis of variance was performed. The Tukey post hoc test was used in case of significance."

 The study consists of 2 parts, Part A (SAD, including fed/fasted comparison) and Part B (MAD). Part A will be a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, dose-escalating titration of up to 8 single dose levels of HA115. In each cohort, 8 participants will receive active compound and 2 will receive placebo in a randomized manner. Part A will include an assessment of the effect of a high-fat breakfast on the absorption and PK profile of HA115, performed in 10 participants at a single dose to be selected based on SAD results and predicted to be associated with therapeutic plasma concentrations.
 Part B will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled parallel group study of up to 3 dose levels of HA115 given once daily. The number of days of dosing will be based on the results of the PK analysis from Part A. In each cohort, 8 participants will receive active compound fasted and 2 will receive placebo in a randomized, double blind fashion. Safety observations and PK evaluations will be made. Safety data will be reviewed with the SRC prior to each dose escalation."

 The rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI), calculated from respiratory rate divided by tidal volume (RR/VT), is a well-known weaning index and one of the most clinical indices used to predict weaning outcome. However, it has some limitations in predicting weaning outcomes.
 Several previous studies have defined different sensitivities and specificities for RSBI less than 105 to predict weaning success which may lead to errors in predicting successful weaning.
 On the other hand, Weaning failure is likely to occur if there is an imbalance between the load on the inspiratory muscles and their neuromuscular capacity, the imbalance between the mechanical load imposed on the diaphragm which is the major muscle of inspiration and its ability to cope with it. Therefore, evaluating the function of diaphragm before any weaning trial could be useful in predicting weaning outcome.
 Bedside ultrasonography is an easy, fast, noninvasive, and accurate maneuver for evaluating diaphragmatic function. Diaphragmatic displacement (DD) reflecting the ability of diaphragm to produce force and subsequently tidal volume during inspiration and defined as displacement of less than 10 mm has been found to be a predictor of weaning failure among patients in medical ICUs.
 Spadaro et al. proposed substituting VT with DD in the RSBI, and calculating diaphragmatic
 RSBI (DRSBI) would result in a more accurate predictive index than the traditional RSBI."

 Lung transplantation (LT) is an increasingly used treatment for end-stage respiratory disease. However, it is expensive, with hospital costs alone estimated at
 >US$500,000/transplant. Fungal infection and chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) are the major complications of LT. They pose the greatest threat to long-term survival and are reported to occur in 12-50% of LT recipients and cause death in 21.7-82% of these.
 Fungal infections occur in 3 major forms in LT recipients, namely colonisation, trachea-bronchial disease and invasive (or end-organ) disease. Whilst invasive fungal disease (IFD) is associated with the highest mortality, colonisation poses the greatest clinical challenge. It is the most common manifestation, can progress to IFD and can precipitate CLAD.
 Antifungal prophylaxis is used to minimise the risks associated with colonisation.
 Two main antifungal prophylaxis strategies are used. Universal prophylaxis (UP) is defined as the administration of antifungal agents to all patients post-LT. Most centres use UP. A systematic review and meta-analysis showed neither Aspergillus colonisation nor invasive aspergillosis (IA) (the commonest fungal infection in LT recipients) were reduced by UP. Yet it caused side-effects in 29.6%.
 The pre-emptive strategy is defined as the administration of antifungal agents when a fungal pathogen (including in donor specimens) is detected or there is serological evidence of a fungal pathogen in the absence of IFD from a post-LT surveillance bronchoscopy or other clinical investigations (i.e. colonisation).Observational data suggest that a pre-emptive strategy has similar IA incidence rates but fewer adverse drug reactions (ADR) than UP (16.1%). It has been estimated that a pre-emptive strategy can reduce antifungal drug use by 43%.
 No direct comparison of the efficacy, safety and cost of the two strategies has been performed to date. Thus, a randomised controlled trial (RCT) is needed to determine the optimal strategy to reduce the impact of fungal infection in LT recipients. However, before we embark on a definitive phase III RCT powered for clinical outcomes we will perform a pilot feasibility RCT to generate data and answer practical questions to better inform the design of the definitive phase III RCT powered for clinical outcomes."

 This research study is a single arm feasibility trial in which all eligible participants receive five weekly sessions of CBT-I (cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia) delivered before or during their cancer treatments. CBT-I is a non-drug behavioral treatment for insomnia and is considered the most effective treatment for insomnia. However, CBT-I is not routinely offered to cancer patients due to unknowns about its feasibility in this population. Data will be obtained at pre- and post-CBT-I and at eight-week follow-up, and will focus on acceptability, implementation, and efficacy in order to assess feasibility.

 Brachial plexus birth palsy (BPBP) affects approximately 1 in 1,000 newborns, and though the majority of infants regain full function of the affected arm without nerve surgery, those with more severe nerve root injuries will require it. Currently, the best way to determine who will need surgery is to measure the trajectory of muscle recovery by serial clinical exams, but the optimal time for nerve surgery (before 3 months of age) is earlier than the time it usually takes to determine whether the infant needs surgery (up to 6 months.) A non-invasive diagnostic test that identifies the more severe injuries that require surgery earlier than serial exams would improve treatment timing, planning, and accuracy, and ultimately outcomes.
 The investigators have developed a rapid MRI sequence with high spatial resolution and soft tissue contrast that does not require sedation or injection of a contrast agent, and that appeared to accurately assess the severity of nerve injury in infants with BPBP in a pilot study. This pilot study demonstrated that the protocol distinguishes infants who ultimately needed surgery from those who recovered spontaneously. The purpose of the current study is to enroll 100 infants at 3 centers (Shriners Hospital for Children Northern California, Boston
 Children's Hospital, and Gillette Children's Hospital) over a 5 year period to validate this imaging protocol as the new gold standard to determine whether infants with BPBP need surgery, so that individuals who need it could have surgery earlier when it is more effective, and the parents of the majority who will recover spontaneously could be spared months of worry."

 This will be a single site prospective pilot study analyzing the agreement between the results of ED student bedside ultrasonography and radiology-performed ultrasonography.
 Medical students rotating at St Elizabeth Boardman Hospital in the emergency department from any U.S. medical school will be considered for enrollment. Once a rotation has been set up by the medical student and the medical student coordinator, they will be given information on the study being performed and asked if they will be interested. The medical student coordinator will provide them this information. They will be instructed to reply to the co-P.I. if they are interested in participating in the project and given the formal consent to review upon receipt of their affirmative response.
 Potential study participants will be provided envelopes by the co-P.I. containing both the formal written consent to participate in the study as well as a short knowledge test of ultrasound technology and the DVT study itself. The student will be required to first sign the consent form, then take the examination and receive a failing score in order to participate in the study. This pre-test will be based heavily on the quizzes from the EMSono learning modules. Permission has been obtained by Dr. Robert Jones to use these questions as the basis for the pre-test examination. A passing score on the pre-test assessment will be considered to be 80% or higher. The assignment list will be computer-generated using the website www.randomizer.org. Students will be given their numeric randomization assignments based on the order in which they finish their exam, after those that pass are excluded. The exact methodology is described in https://www.randomizer.org/tutorial/lesson2.html. Utilizing this methodology, a randomly-generated value of 1 shall be online training, and 2 shall be in-person training.
 The study itself shall consist of two arms separated by training. The patient inclusion criteria will not vary between the two arms, only the level of student training. Additional data will be obtained regarding study participants prior to the start of the study, including: training level, approximate number of lower extremity ultrasound studies performed by the participant in the past, overall ultrasound experience, and any formal sonographic education or credentialing.
 In the first arm, participating students must have completed the Practical Scanning and
 Lower Extremity DVT Ultrasound modules contained within the EMSono online ultrasound instruction. In the second arm, participating student must have attended the in-person training that will be provided by an RDMS-certified ultrasonographer, Kathryn Gentile. The training will last approximately 4 hours in each training method and will include instruction on performing a B-mode compression test of the deep veins of the lower extremities to assess for presence or absence of DVT. There will be no significant difference in the approximate content covered in each training method. Each arm must pass a practical examination in which they must demonstrate basic proficiency in the use of the ultrasound device as well as the ability to obtain all views necessary for their examinations. Failure of the practical exam will result in exclusion from the remainder of the study. They will also be required to repeat the pre-test assessment which will be tracked for improvement from their first pre-test assessment. Both arms will have their pre-test assessment, training, and post-test practical examination monitored by the P.I., co-P.I., ultrasonographer, or another suitable proctor.
 Emergency department patients whom the physician has a clinical suspicion for lower extremity
 DVT or PE and have intention of ordering formal radiology department performed ultrasound will be consented to also have a bedside ultrasound performed by study participant. This consent will be obtained by either the resident or attending physician providing the care of the patient; at which point, the physician will inform whatever student study participant is currently on shift in the department. If there are multiple student study participants present and on shift in the department, the physician must inform a student in an appropriate manner. If a student has already begun to see the patient that is to receive the DVT assessment, then they shall be the study participant selected. If no student has begun to see the patient, then the student with the fewest number of US DVT scans performed in the course of this study will be the study participant selected. If neither of these factors are definitive, then the ED physician shall decide the student to perform the examination via coin toss. If a physical coin is unavailable, then a smartphone coin toss app will be considered an acceptable alternative. The device utilized to obtain these exams shall be a
 Philips Lumify linear 12-4 MHz probe attached to a Samsung Galaxy View 19 tablet.
 In each arm, each participant shall perform the examination according to the methods described by the teaching methods; including what veins are considered to be studied and what techniques to utilize in order to assess for the presence or absence of DVT. The study participant must perform the bedside ultrasound and record their results on a standardized document which will be placed in a locked box inside the department. The information recorded shall include: patient information, reason for exam, date and time of exam, extremity studied, technical limitations, number ultrasound for the study participant, and findings.
 Data on the form shall be standardized and in check-box form whenever possible to avoid ambiguity. This sheet will be completed and placed in the locked box prior to the patient receiving their formal radiology department performed examination, the timing of which will be verified by the resident or attending physician. At the completion of the study, all charts will be reviewed by the co-P.I. and the results provided on the sheet shall be compared to the results of the formal radiologic ultrasound and the data will be analyzed.
 Of note, no treatment will be initiated based on the student ultrasound alone. If the suspicion remains very high and for some reason there is an urgent need to initiate treatment (e.g. admitted patient needing bridge orders), then the resident or attending must either perform an ultrasound exam themselves or must be able to interpret the images obtained by the formal study as the basis for treatment. If the patient is diagnosed with a PE prior to the formal study being completed, therapy will not be withheld until the formal US as it is clearly indicated in PE. Every attempt will be made to document this on the chart or paper form as applicable so that the chart can be reviewed more thoroughly for times of meds given/scans done and studies and be appropriately rejected if significant confounding exists, such as a positive DVT on student scan, initiation of anticoagulation for PE, then subsequent formal US negative for DVT. Further, although the diagnosis of DVT does exist across a spectrum, the presence of any thrombus on the formal radiological study is cause to initiate treatment, regardless of whether or not it is hemodynamically significant. As such, the positive presence of a thrombus will be treated as an affirmative result in both studies; and a negative result will be considered as a complete lack of any evidence for DVT.
 Students in particular present a unique research opportunity, as there is little existing evidence on training truly naïve ultrasound users in the Emergency Department. Prior evidence has focused primarily on resident and attending training in the use of bedside ultrasound.
 Further, this study simultaneously represents a significant learning opportunity for students who choose to enroll, in addition to having routine access to the ultrasound equipment usually reserved for use by resident and attending physicians. The research goals of this study will be modeled after the studies that exist for physician training. Therefore, the investigators will conduct the study for a period of 12 months, aiming to obtain a minimum of 100 studies. There will be no upper bound on the number of examinations performed.
 At the end of each rotation period, the studies will be collected from the locked box by the co-P.I. and the results of the formal radiological study will be compared to the results of the student-performed study. The paper studies from the locked box will then be transferred to a locked drawer within the locked EM resident's workroom. Only the P.I., co-P.I., applicable research assistant, and residency coordinator will have access to the locked drawer. These will then be transferred to a primary and backup encrypted flash drive in a spreadsheet file using the standardized results on the data collection sheet and the patient's visit number, so that the drive does not contain any identifiable PHI. The backup drive shall remain in the locked drawer. The research assistant shall be responsible for compiling this data on a semi-weekly basis as well as generation and maintenance of the data files on the encrypted flash drive. It is expected that this will data processing task will last for 5 hours every 2 weeks for the duration of the project at a cost of $20 per hour.
 The data will be analyzed and relevant statistical analyses performed on the data to determine whether there is a statistically significant difference between the radiological study result and the student study result in each arm, as well as the comparison between the two arms. These analyses will be performed either by the P.I., co-P.I., or an appropriate research assistant utilizing SPSS or similar statistical analysis application to determine differences in sensitivity and specificity of exams grouped by training type. One training method will be considered as superior to the other only if the p value for this data is
 <0.05."
NCT03655132,204396,2018-10-25T00:00:00Z,Clinical Trial Description,204396,AACT,"
 The research study for this career development plan involves the development, iterative user testing, and evaluation of an online ACT treatment program for Veterans with chronic pain.
 This study will determine whether a larger-scale, more definitive VACT-CP full scale efficacy trial is indicated.
 Phase 1: Development Phase (15 months): I will develop a detailed VACT-CP protocol for individual online treatment. Treatment techniques will be based on previously-developed ACT treatments for chronic pain, as well as additional ACT training I will obtain during the early phase of the CDA-2. During this phase, mental health and other clinical staff providing pain care at the Bedford VAMC (n = 10) will provide feedback and input on the intervention content.
 Phase 2: Pilot Evaluation of Intervention Components in Field-Based Iterative Usability
 Testing (21 months): The investigators will recruit Veterans (n=15) with chronic pain for usability testing, to assess the delivery mode, and utilize an Integrated Technology
 Acceptance Model to iteratively assess feasibility and usability of the VACT-CP online treatment. This portion of the project will focus on refining the delivery mode, and revising chronic pain intervention content as necessary. With my mentors, I will review the adequacy, utility of specific procedures, and intervention foci to revise the online treatment accordingly.
 Phase 3: Feasibility Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial (30 months): The investigators will assess the feasibility and acceptability using a Stage 1b RCT pilot test comparing VACT-CP (n
 = 20) to a wait-list control group (n = 20), including ease of recruitment, retention in each condition, treatment receptivity, attrition and retention in each condition, sustained participation, and the assessment process. The investigators will also describe preliminary data on the impact of VACT-CP vs. the control condition on pain-related functioning related to social, occupational, and physical functioning, emotional functioning, mental health, and quality of life.
 PHASE 1: INTERVENTION DEVELOPMENT
 The goal of this phase will be to 1) adapt ACT manualized treatment of chronic pain in
 Veterans into an online platform using the ECA as the intervention coach, and 2) gather qualitative feedback from chronic pain providers and content experts (n = 10 - 12) on the
 VACT-CP system for intervention refinement and potential benefits, barriers, referral concerns, and overall thoughts on the VACT-CP system.
 Initial Development of the VACT-CP System
 Procedure. The development of the intervention and its revision will be an iterative process over Phases 1 (Intervention Development) and 2 (Feasibility and Usability Testing) (specifications for intervention revision for Phase 2 are below) and will include: 1) reviewing existing ACT CP treatment manuals with mentors; 2) developing a preliminary online version of the intervention, with mentor input, 3) revising the intervention based on mentor and consultant feedback.
 Creation of the initial VACT-CP platform will include collaboration with mentors , as well as the Northeastern Personal Health Informatics team at Northeastern University led by Dr.
 Timothy Bickmore. Using input from this team of experts, as well as my own experience in educational technology and online course creation, I will create a basic prototype of the intervention including the main VACT-CP content components, alignment of session goals and outcomes, and the creation of a corresponding patient workbook with information on the system. This process will also include close mentorship between Drs. Kelly and Heapy to assess current ACT for CP manualized treatment, and adaption of this content to the online system.
 VACT-CP Treatment Content and Structure. The following components will be emphasized in
 VACT-CP based on previous manualized ACT-chronic pain treatment by Vowles and Sorrell Life with Chronic Pain: An Acceptance-based Approach Therapist Guide and Patient Workbook and utilizing ECA technology to create a personalized, therapeutic experience. Creation of the intervention will entail modification of the ECA image, creation of the intervention scripts and programming for the online user-experience. Participants will receive eight online modules, provided as weekly sessions that will feature an ECA (virtual therapist) as a treatment guide.
 Adaption to Online Platform. Treatment content for VACT-CP will be integrated into the
 Northeastern University platform created and maintained by the relational agent research group managed by Dr. Timothy Bickmore, which has already programmed and run several
 VA-specific, IRB-approved interventions. Dr. Bickmore has confirmed that both the budget and timeline for this project are appropriate, and thus feasible. This website will be available to Veterans for free for this project, and Veterans will be able to re-access the any module where they left off, or restart a module if preferred after logging out using their de-identified username and password provided by research staff. For the purposes of pilot testing with providers and Veterans, the user interface will also first be mocked-up using
 PowerPoint slides, and following feedback from providers will then be adapted to the current
 ECA online platform (Phases 1 and 2). This platform will include elements such as personalized conversations with the embodied conversation agent, starting with a mindfulness exercise at the beginning of each module, and moving through major session components. Each session will incorporate different interactive psychoeducation experiences for each session, goal setting and tracking, and finally end with weekly homework aligned with the goals of the next session.
 Planning for and addressing potential safety concerns online is a major concern, and consultation for the inclusion of safety procedures and information has been provided by Drs.
 Kelly, Heapy, and Greene. Consequently, in addition to the modules, information regarding the
 Veteran Crisis Hotline will be incorporated into the website with the addition of a button providing phone number information and the PI's number will be included within the website as well should a Veteran need to access clinical staff. The investigators will also assess with
 Veterans whether they were able to locate these resources early in the usability and pilot testing.
 Qualitative Provider Interviews
 Procedure. A sample of 10 current mental health providers (including social workers, physicians, PACT nurses, and psychologists) who provide treatment for chronic pain at the
 ENRM VA will be interviewed for formative assessment of the potential benefits, concerns, and institutional VHA dissemination issues for the VACT-CP intervention, using a semi-structured interview guide and a think-aloud strategy for intervention review.
 Sample. Providers will be recruited from presentations and emails to Primary Care/Behavioral
 Staff and the Mental Health Service Line at the Bedford VAMC, and scheduled for a time for a 45 minute to one hour interview during regular work hours, though potential participants will also have the option to interview over the phone. Participants will be consented for participating in the interview and having their participation audio-recorded.
 Interview Guide. This interview will include open-ended questions related to palatability of the intervention, feasibility of engagement with Veterans with chronic pain, interest or potential concerns with referring Veterans to such a program, and reactions to a short walk-through of the intervention. The purpose of these questions is to gather information from valuable stakeholders and potential referral-providers on VACT-CP system to address refinement of the program, possible benefits, barriers, referral concerns, and overall thoughts on the VACT-CP system Questions for palatability are based on the organizational perspective components of the Practical, Robust Implementation and Sustainability Model (PRISM). Interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed.
 Provider Interview Analyses Qualitative data analysis will use a thematic approach for the data related to the goal of ascertaining intervention palatability and feasibility and referral issues, and a narrative approach for data collected with the goal of intervention refinement. Two independent reviewers will code Section 2 of the interview transcriptions using open-ended coding. Each element will be summarized separately, and overall summary themes will be generated. Summary tables of key points will be generated, similar to previous formative assessments performed. These tables will ensure data saturation has been reached for both provider input. Two reviewers will analyze qualitative data using a modified grounded coding to identify themes using audio recordings after each interview. Intervention areas will be modified as feedback is given. Each set of interviews will take place with 3 - 4 participants, to allow for iterative adjustment of the intervention based on feedback.
 Number of changes needed for each intervention area will be tracked, and less intervention refinement will be anticipated by the end of the interview cycle. However, if intervention palatability is not achieved, further testing using other providers will be utilized. The generated information and themes will be utilized for development and refinement of the
 VACT-CP intervention, to learn from major stakeholders important areas for potential revision during intervention development.
 PHASE 2: FEASIBILITY AND USABILITY TESTING The goals of Phase 2 are to: 1) gain further feedback on the VACT-CP treatment by gathering information from Veterans via usability testing to; 2) assess Veteran interest, satisfaction, and usability of the online VACT-CP treatment; 3) iteratively address any technological concerns. This Phase will allow for feedback and preliminary support that the Phase 3 small-pilot RCT is merited.
 Given past research suggesting that similar interventions are usable and beneficial, the investigators anticipate that usability findings suggesting concerns or places for revision will not be such a strong barrier that the intervention will not be at all useful in this population. However, should Phase 2 data indicate that a small-pilot RCT is not merited, the usability information from this Phase will be utilized to inform further VACT-CP refinement until the usability bugs have been worked out and the system is ready for testing in a feasibility pilot RCT. This information will also be disseminated to inform future online chronic pain treatment development.
 Sample Information
 Sample Size: No single participant reviewer can identify all the usability problems in a system; typically 3-5 reviewers can identify 80% of the usability problems, with diminishing returns from additional reviewers per round of testing. The investigators will conduct 3 rounds of usability testing with 4-5 Veterans per round to assess and iteratively address usability concerns (n=12-15 total).
 Recruitment. Subjects will be 15 patients primarily recruited by referral from the Primary
 Care Behavioral Health at the ENRM VA Hospital. Eligible participants will have a current diagnosis of non-cancer chronic pain, defined as related to either Musculoskeletal pain or
 Joint Problems/Osteoarthritis or presence of chronic pain of at least mild to moderate severity. The investigators have decided to target joint and musculoskeletal pain as these have been shown to best respond to psychological, behavioral interventions, whereas neuropathic pain and headaches having less research supporting this. However, the investigators will not exclude for other diagnoses of pain, as this is typical and would not necessarily preclude Veterans from benefiting from the treatment.
 The investigators have verified that there are 2,605 Veterans who were seen over the past year (i.e., having had at least two appointments for pain) at the Bedford VA with chronic, non-cancer pain concerns, suggesting that the recruitment goal of 15 Veterans within 3 months to do a single-session usability test for Phase 2 is achievable. In addition, I will give presentations to primary care providers, social workers, and mental health clinicians at the
 Bedford VA to enhance recruitment. Using CPRS, Veterans meeting eligibility criteria for chronic pain seen within 12 months at the Bedford VA will also be sent letters inviting them to participate.
 Screening Procedures. Callers will be screened by phone. Eligible participants will be scheduled for an in-person assessment with the PI, who will confirm study eligibility and obtain informed consent. A research associate affiliated with the research study will then conduct clinician-rated assessments, and subjects will complete self-report measures.
 Feasibility and Usability Assessment Procedures Eligible Veterans will come to the Bedford VA to complete baseline demographic and health measures. Following baseline assessment, Veterans will be provided with an iPad that will walk them through different portions of the user interface and treatment set-up, during which time they will be asked questions and recorded as a usability interview. Specifically, different images for options of the virtual therapy guide, as well as a PowerPoint with information about the user interface will be shown. Next,
 Veterans will be provided with written instructions for use, and do a behavioral walk-through of how to use the online system. Patients will be given instructions on interacting with the system, and will then walk through a portion of the treatment using PowerPoint slides that will simulate the VACT-CP treatment and usability interface, and then complete the Usability
 Survey and SUS (see measures below). During this time, the Veterans will take part in a contextual interview wherein Veterans move through the system unguided and are observed and asked questions about their experience. After this, additional, open-ended questions will be asked regarding Veteran preferences.
 For purposes of feedback and iterative program development, the Veteran will only be provided with the part of the first VACT-CP session during this time. The participant will then be left in a secure, confidential room to walk through the VACT-CP system on their own, during which time their use of the system will be recorded. Approximately 4 - 5 Veterans will be recruited and participate in this usability testing at a time, with 3 different usability testing arms, in order to allow for time to iteratively address any functionality issues or concerns with the user interface. Following this walkthrough, participants will be provided with measures of demographics, usability and health information technology use, including a retrospectively worded version of the Usability Survey items (e.g., I enjoyed using the
 VACT-CP program) and a semi-structured qualitative exit interview. Participants will receive compensation for their in-person visit, which should take approximately 2 - 3 hours.
 Assessment Measures A broad range of reliable and valid measures will be used to provide an assessment of chronic pain difficulties, demographic information, and technology use, technology interest, and comfort. In addition, Veterans will be observed while interfacing with the VACT-CP system, recorded, and asked questions by the interviewer. This will consist of specific questions related to the different parts of the system the veteran interacts with (e.g., the ECA design, structure of the modules, feedback system) as well as more open-ended when not provided with specific cues (e.g., what are you trying to get to from this page, what could be better about how this page is set up, etc.) Questions will be open-ended in nature, and address the extent of any problems with accessing and using the VACT-CP treatment online, how they might perceive the usefulness or importance of VACT-CP focal areas of treatment, whether they would recommend this treatment to a fellow Veteran, and any problems or concerns they may have with using the VACT-CP program.
 Using this additional, open-ended interview protocol, the investigators will also inquire as whether they would be interested in using the VACT-CP treatment at home and the role of their virtual therapist in the patient's interest in the treatment, and about past strategies or tools the patient used to address their chronic pain issues and whether the VACT-CP treatment might seem more useful than prior options or strategies. Finally, participants will be asked to indicate what, if any, changes they would make to the treatment to assist in self-management of their chronic pain. This will also include assessing their interest in it complementary and alternative methods of pain management (stretching, yoga, progressive muscle relaxation, etc.) to assess if it would be useful and feasible to add these options to the platform later if desired. The interview will be video recorded and coded to look for similar themes, difficulties, revisions, and strengths of the system.
 Intervention Revisions During Phase 2, in which Veterans will interact with the VACT-CP online treatment, the investigators will: 1) gather feedback from Veterans regarding acceptability and usefulness of the treatment, 3) gather and analyze complementary data from
 SUS-8, 4) address any technological issues as they arise, and 5) examine preliminary data from this phase of the study. Modifications to the treatment will be based upon: 1) acceptability and feasibility of the online treatment, and 3) qualitative feedback obtained from patients, therapist, and mentors. Individual feedback sessions at the end of phase 2 will be held to gather information for refining the treatment manual and make it acceptable to patients.
 The investigators anticipate that the Veteran intervention reviewers might miss bugs or other user interface problems, and anticipate that some revisions to the online system and program may need to be made for Phase 3. For instance, one potential issue that may arise might be an inability for the Veteran to read the text on the tablet screen. After receiving this information during an initial feedback round, the researchers will amend the program with a potential solutions i.e. text size or text color being altered, with the revised version then being piloted in the next round of Veteran user testing. Some usability challenges will be addressed with introductory handouts/tutorial materials/orientation to the program at the beginning of the intervention session. In addition, large organizational issues will be discussed before moving on to platform refinement.
 Data Management Patient files will be kept in a locked cabinet and password protected files where data will be encoded with ID numbers. IDs will be unrelated to any identifying information. Video recordings will be stored on a secure, VA approved server. The majority of data analysis will consist of qualitative and observational methods, including coding qualitative interview data and coded video files. Data will be checked for inconsistencies, omissions and errors. As only 15 subjects will participate in Phase 2, only summary quantitative statistics will be computed to describe the sample and to determine outcome on the study measures. Data gathered through qualitative interviews and quantitative measures will be housed on a VA-approved cloud-based data storage server.
 Data Collection and Analysis Qualitative Combined Usability and Contextual Interview. The investigators will focus on usability and feasibility to address Aim 2. During 60-75-minute usability sessions held in private, secure rooms SoCRR rooms within the Bedford VAMC, participants will assess the usability of the VACT-CP intervention using a think-aloud protocol, verbalizing their thoughts as they navigate the website. After a period of exploration with the site, the research staff will use a pre-created protocol to ask Veterans to perform a series of tasks on the website (i.e., entering therapy goals, accessing the different modules, completing pre-session assessment, interacting with the virtual therapist). The usability testing space is already equipped with a computer, tablet, and a web camera. As a participant navigates the intervention website on a tablet or computer, their actions will be recorded through webcam electronically, and Dr. Reilly will observe the actions in real-time within the room, and a blinded observer/note taker. Drs. Waring and
 Quigley will consult on usability testing procedures.
 The video recordings and notes made by Dr. Reilly during user testing will be transcribed and analyzed using NVivo software available through the Bedford VAMC. A modified consensual qualitative research (CQR) approach will be utilized to code the transcribed videos, which
 Dr. Reilly has been trained in and utilized in past peer-reviewed publications. CQR can be particularly useful in allowing for a team of coders to identify themes arising in both structured and more open-ended interview moments. Dr. Reilly will develop an initial codebook for using in coding based on the key activities and questions in the user-testing protocol.
 Dr. Reilly and the research associate will then employ the codebook in identifying usability-themes within the videos, with an additional research staff identified to act as a code auditor. According to CQR, the following processes occur to allow for depth and breadth in describing the shared experiences of participants: (b) two coders utilize the initial codebook throughout the data analysis process to foster multiple perspectives; (c) consensus is researched between coders about the meaning of the data; (d) at least one auditor must check the work of the primary team of judges and minimize potential bias; and (e) domains and themes are reported in terms of the frequency of arising themes.
 Themes will then be categorized according to the following CQR groupings: general (include all or all but one of the cases), typical (include more than half of the cases up to the cutoff for general), and variant (at least two cases up to the cutoff for typical).
 Specifically, the themes generated by this qualitative data will be used to identify user performance measures, errors and difficulties, and tasks that do not meet acceptable criteria, and general trends and categories of users' behavior such as how well users can complete an assigned task on the VACT-CP system and where they are encountering problems.
 Using this method, the investigators will classify all general comments regarding usability as necessary to include in iterative development, while variant and typical will be discussed within the research group to decide upon potential ways to incorporate this feedback into intervention refinement.
 In addition, Veterans will complete a series of brief usability questionnaires following user testing and the qualitative interview. Usability Survey and SUS data will be input into
 REDCap, reported descriptively using SPSS software, and used to describe Veteran's general perceptions and opinions of the technology's usability, both within the controlled testing setting and for future use within their home. This feedback will then be triangulated with qualitative data, and used to iteratively refine the VACT-CP program between the three waves of user testing. The investigators will complete this process with 4-5 Veterans per round;
 Dr. Reilly then summarize suggested changes, obtain input from the full mentoring team, then meet with Dr. Bickmore's staff to implement potential changes. Results will be published to inform other researchers about usability findings related to format feedback, user interface, interest, and perceptions of behavioral intervention content.
 PHASE 3: FEASIBILITY PILOT RCT
 The goals of the feasibility pilot RCT study phase are to conduct a Stage 1b RCT pilot trial to: 3a) explore relationships between Veteran traits, usability beliefs, and technology perceptions on intended and actual use of the VACT-CP system; 3b) describe differences in
 VACT-CP versus a wait-list control group on pre- and post-test measures of pain acceptance, pain level, pain-related functioning, and quality of life, treatment satisfaction with the
 VACT-CP system and ACT-related outcomes including pain acceptance, valued living and experiential avoidance; 3c) evaluative the relative feasibility and acceptability of the
 VACT-CP intervention procedure and waitlist control, including ease of recruitment, retention in each condition, treatment receptivity, attrition and retention in each condition, sustained participation, and the assessment process. A total of 40 Veterans will be enrolled to test the VACT-CP system within their home.
 Participant Selection and Recruitment
 Sample Size: Based on the previous recruitment of Veterans with chronic pain at the Bedford
 VAMC, the investigators estimate that approximately 65% of Veterans screened for participation by research staff, recruitment letters, flyer recruitment, and referrals from
 PCBH staff (N=60 enrolled participants) will meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria and be eligible for the pilot trial. Similar to Phase 2, the investigators will not exclude for other diagnoses of pain. Given this, the investigators will aim to recruit a total of 60 participants over fifteen months total to allow for the desired final 40 participants screened as eligible and randomized into the pilot RCT study, specifically aiming for recruiting 3-4 participants per month. Subjects for the proposed study will be recruited over the course of approximately 15 months and be screened according to their presence of chronic pain and other important.
 Subjects will be recruited from the Bedford VAMC, where 2,605 Veterans are currently (as of
 November, 2017) being seen at the Bedford VAMC for chronic, non-cancer pain concerns, suggesting that the investigators' final recruitment goal of 40 persons total enrolled (1.5% of the total Bedford population) is feasible. In addition, I will give presentations to primary care providers, social workers, and mental health clinicians at the Bedford VA to enhance recruitment. Using CPRS, Veterans meeting eligibility criteria for chronic pain seen within one month at the Bedford VA will also be sent letters inviting them to participate.
 Study Procedures and Assessment
 Treatment Procedures. Following recruitment, a research associate not otherwise involved in the study will screen participants prior to enrollment. Veterans will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio, with a research staff member utilizing and keeping the schedule. Veterans randomized to VACT-CP will receive 8 online-module based weekly sessions of treatment via personal computer or provided tablet with wireless accessibility at the Bedford VAMC. Veterans in the waitlist control will be provided with a list of common pain resources at the Bedford VAMC.
 The VACT-CP program will be housed on a secure web server through Northeastern University, with no Veteran private health information collected by the system.
 If during Phase 2 it becomes clear that more or less sessions are necessary (based on indicators previously discussed for usability and feasibility testing), the number of sessions for Phase 3 will be changed accordingly. Veterans in both conditions will complete the assessment battery (including all measures below, except for the treatment satisfaction and working alliance inventory) at baseline. In addition, the full battery will be taken at mid-point of the intervention phase (4 weeks) and at the end, immediately following the treatment (8 weeks). Veterans will be tracked in terms of their post-referral treatment engagement (e.g., enrolling in any of the pain-resource options on the handout). In addition, a research associate will call the Veteran at weeks 3 and 6 and conduct a brief safety assessment and qualitative interview with Veterans assess for potential suicidality, usability issues, and participant health and well-being."

 Whereas three percent of amateur athletes injure their anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) each year, this percentage can be as high as 15% in elite athletes. Because the ACL contains mechanoreceptors it directly influences the neuromuscular control of the knee. ACL deficiency leads to partial deafferentiation which, in turn, alters spinal and supraspinal motor control.
 Return to sports following ACL injuries is mostly decided based on time since surgery; however, this decision process produces unsuccessful outcomes; e.g. high re-injury rates or athletes not being able to return to their pre-injury sport levels. The rate of return to preinjury play levels for non-professional pivoting athletes for example is 65%. A recent evidence-based clinical update revealed that it is currently unclear whether there is a benefit of supervised physical therapy rehabilitation compared to home-based rehabilitation or no rehabilitation at all, and comparisons between 19-week with 32-week rehabilitation programmes show no differences in terms of laxity, range of motion, knee function, or measures of leg muscle strength. Evidence-based guidelines suggest practitioners should generally follow a moderate recommendation, which means that the benefits of treatment exceed the potential harm; however, the quality/applicability of the supporting evidence is not as strong. Many rehabilitation programs currently target biomechanical factors; e.g. muscle strength, balance and plyometric function, and consider to a rather lesser extend cognitive or neurological components.
 Brain activation for knee flexion/extension motion alters following ACL reconstruction. The brain activation profile following ACL reconstruction may indicate a shift toward a visual-motor strategy as opposed to a sensory-motor strategy to engage in knee movement. This recent research evidence suggests that rehabilitation protocols for ACL reconstruction should additionally be considering neurocognition and its role in movement, neuromuscular control, and injury risk to help improve intervention effectiveness.
 However, there is a lack of evidence concerning the feasibility of implementing neurocognitive exercise interventions in a primary rehabilitation program aimed at restoring function following ACL injury. New treatments usually have to go through a series of phases to test whether they are safe and effective before larger scale studies and application in clinical practice are to be considered. The aim of this pilot study was to perform a phase II trial according the model for complex interventions advocated by the British Medical Research
 Council to test the feasibility and effects of a conventional ACL injury rehabilitation program with added neurocognitive training in a group of ACL injured individuals. This study aims to: (1) compare ACL injured individuals with non-injured individuals, (2) develop an exercise intervention based on research literature theory and to deliver it to ACL injured individuals, (3) evaluate the feasibility of the intervention and the ability to recruit and retain ACL injured individuals, and (4) assess whether the treatment has some effect on neural drive and physical performance."

 Voice difficulty is a common complaint following thyroidectomy, and while the procedure risks injury to laryngeal nerves involved in voice production, voice difficulty is common even in the absence of evident injury to these nerves. The cause of voice change in these situations is not well defined, and multiple mechanisms have been suggested. Some potential mechanisms include trauma to the laryngeal skeleton from intraoperative manipulation of the strap muscles, cricothyroid muscle, thyroid, cartilage, or trachea. However, it is also possible that irritation due to intubation and edema to the neck and oral or pharyngeal soft tissues that develops after the surgery as a result of intubation plays a role in postoperative voice change. These mechanisms can occur in any operation requiring general endotracheal anesthesia even when the laryngeal nerves are not specifically at risk of injury.
 The purpose of this study is to evaluate voice outcomes after thyroidectomy (both objective and subjective patient and clinician reported) and compare those to voice outcomes after other surgeries that do not put the recurrent or superior laryngeal nerves at risk or traumatize the laryngeal skeleton, but do require general endotracheal anesthesia. The primary assessment tool will be the Voice Handicap Index-10 (VHI-10), which is a questionnaire that asks about the patient's interpretation of his/her voice quality and the impact it is having on daily activities. Data analysis will be done to see if participants have a significant change in their pre-operation VHI-10 score at approximately 1 week and 3 months post-operation. Additional assessments tools will include nasolaryngoscopy and nasolaryngeal stroboscopy to assess global vocal fold function, Consensus Auditory Perceptual
 Evaluation of Voice (CAPE-V) and computerized speech lab (CSL) acoustics to assess voice quality, and vocal aerodynamic analysis to determine air flow through the larynx."

 Increased Intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in
 ICU patients with consequent pulmonary, hepatic, central nervous and renal system impairments.
 The increase in IAP is rarely diagnosed in ICU and the lack of diagnosis of this condition may lead to the worsening of patient prognoses because of retardation of appropriate interventions .
 The current literatures show conflicting cutoff values of IAP that predict AKI, possibly due to the fact that many studies were conducted before publishing of the first Consensus of
 IAH/ACS, which standardized the measurement method of IAP.
 Intra-abdominal hypertension is defined as a sustained or repeated pathologic elevation of intra-abdominal pressure greater than 12 mmHg [Malbrain et al 2004, cheathamML et al 2007].
 Intra-abdominal hypertension is graded as follows:
 -  Grade I Intra-abdominal pressure 12-15 mmHg.
 -  Grade II Intra-abdominal pressure 16-20 mmHg.
 -  Grade III Intra-abdominal pressure 21-25 mmHg.
 -  Grade IV Intra-abdominal pressure greater than 25 mmHg Various risk factors contribute to the development of IAH in medical ICU including; massive fluid resuscitation (> 3500 ml/24 h), ileus, respiratory, renal, or liver dysfunction, hypothermia, acidosis, anemia, oliguria, and hyperlactatemia ."

 General anesthesia is the most common technique for this surgery. The local anesthesia is less common but it allows to obtain the same surgical result. This last technique being more recent little study compared these two techniques in terms of complications and postoperative consequences.
 The investigators will randomize patients into two groups (a general anesthesia group and a locoregional anesthesia group).
 General anesthesia provides complete immobility and optimal surgical comfort but is a source of multiple complications, especially in a population of polypathological and polymedicated elderly patients (which is the population affected by chronic subdural hematomas).
 Locoregional anesthesia requires special technical training, leads to complete analgesia of the surgical procedure but does not involve complete immobility of the patient, however this technique probably leads to less postoperative complications and allows a more early rehabilitation."

 Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia causing ischemic stroke. The
 CHA2DS2-VASc score was developed to estimate the stroke rate in patients with non-valvular
 AF, and high scores predict a raised annual stroke risk. The yearly stroke risks without treatment in patients with CHA2DS2-VASc score 2 and 9 are 2.2% and 15.2% respectively. For patients with increased stroke risk (CHA2DS2-VASc score ≧2), warfarin or other novel oral anticoagulants (NOAC) recommended for stroke prevention. Despite the effectiveness of current pharmacological therapies for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation, around 20% of patients discontinue therapy - whether new oral anticoagulants (NOAC) or warfarin because of side effects and/or bleeding. In addition, warfarin needs to be dosed individually to target an international normalized ratio (INR) of 2-3 for striking an optimal balance between bleeding and ischemic stroke events. This, combined with drug-drug interaction that occurs with both NOACs and warfarin, results in inadequate stroke protection in a substantial portion of AF patients. The LAA is the source of 90% of cardiac emboli attributed to stroke events. This is a windsock-like structure on the lateral border of the left atrium with internal trabeculations, and being a confined space, is prone to blood stasis and thrombus formation. Currently, there are surgical, epicardial and percutaneous techniques for occluding this structure in order to reduce stroke in AF patients cannot take long term oral anticoagulants, and the percutaneous route is intuitively the most attractive given its relative non-invasiveness. The two devices in most widespread use for percutaneous LAA closure worldwide are the Watchman (Boston Scientific, Natick, MA, USA) and the Amplatzer
 Cardiac Plug (ACP) (Abbott, IL, CA USA). However, both devices have limitations including the need for relatively large delivery sheaths (9-14 French) and limited recapture and repositioning capabilities.

 LAA occluder constructed from a nitinol mesh and polyester membranes and consists of an umbrella and a cover connected by a short central waist. The device is delivered by an 8-10

 Stroke is the second leading cause of death (the first in women in industrialized countries), the second cause of dementia and the third leading cause of disability. For a middle-aged person, the risk of developing a stroke is 1/5 in women and 1/6 in men over a lifetime.
 Moreover, stroke is a disease that can be considered chronic. Indeed, in France, the survival rate one month after a stroke is 80-90%. However, at least 50% of survivors retain a severe disability and almost all require long-term care. The medico-economic impact of stroke is therefore important in both the initial and chronic phases. Nevertheless, none of the French stroke registries consider the burden of post-stroke disability. In addition, there is limited data available on the impact of geographic disparities on the prognosis of stroke.
 Population studies are essential to accurately identify the incidence and burden of stroke, thereby supporting public health policy, guiding the allocation of resources, and evaluating the effectiveness of preventive strategies for a population. This is why we propose to create a Norman Observatory of Stroke. It will include an urban and rural population and will aim to become a population register."

 This prospective study was conducted at the Red Cross War Memorial Children's Hospital (RCWMCH) and recruitment ran from between March 2015 to March 2018. All patients presenting with convulsive status epilepticus (CSE) who presented to the medical emergency unit at
 RCWMCH and needed therapeutic intervention were entered into the study by the attending medical staff. Study data was collected using REDCap hosted by the University of Cape Town's eResearch Centre and the study was approved by the UCT Human Research Ethics Council (UCT
 HREC 297/2005).
 Definitions The definition of CSE was defined as any convulsive seizure that lasted longer than five minutes or multiple discrete seizures between which there is no extended period of recovery between events (Trinka et al., 2015). The onset of CSE was defined as the time provided by the caregiver who accompanied the child. The time to admission and to treatment were recorded by the staff in the unit. If children were admitted multiple times, each admission was captured independently, but only data from the first admission was included in this report . The full diagnosis of CSE was described using the multiaxial classification system. However, as it was not possible to perform EEG on all patients, this axes was excluded. Febrile status epilepticus was defined .
 Treatment protocols Upon entry into the study, children were randomly allocated to one of two protocols . Both these protocols are well-established treatment protocols used in the sub-Saharan African setting for the management of SE . Randomization of protocols was performed using a free online platform (Research Randomizer ©). Both protocols began with children receiving first-line benzodiazepines (either midazolam, lorazepam or diazepam) which were either administered intravenously (IV), per rectally, intranasally or sublingually. If the children did not respond to single dose of benzodiazepines, they were given a second dose 5-10 minutes after the first dose. Pre-hospital administration of benzodiazepines by emergency services were counted if administered intravenously. However, all other routes of administration were not counted due to the lack of consistency in their administration.
 If CSE continued after two doses of benzodiazepines, children were then randomized to second-line agents according to the protocol allocated to them. The one protocol, termed
 'Phenobarbital' (PHB), instructed the clinician to give giving an IV bolus of phenobarbital (20mg/kg ). If CSE did not terminate after 5 - 10 minutes, a second dose was given at half the dosage (10mg/kg) and a third dose (10mg/kg) was given if CSE persisted 5-10 minutes after that.
 In the second protocol, termed 'Phenytoin / Midazolam infusion' (PHY/MDZ), children were given a dose (20mg/kg) of IV phenytoin mixed with 50mL of normal saline solution and administered over 30 minutes . If the patient was still in CSE 5-10 minutes after the phenytoin was given, they were then started on a midazolam infusion. This included a loading dose of IV midazolam (0.2mg/kg) followed by an infusion set at 3mg/kg into 50mL 5% dextrose water given at a rate of 1-4 mL/hour (equivalent to 1-4 mcg/kg/min ).
 If a patient child did not respond to the PHB or the PHY/MDZ protocols, they were referred to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Other reasons for admission to the PICU included respiratory depression following administration of the second-line agent, need for inotropic support, etiology-related concerns requiring intensive monitoring (e.g. severe electrolyte imbalances) and or prolonged state of a depressed level of consciousness.
 Demographic data inclusive of age, sex, etiologies, pre-existing medications, previous medical conditions and co-morbidities were recorded.
 Outcome measures In comparing the two treatment protocols, we will only focused on the short-term outcomes of the children in each treatment protocol. These include how the agents affected the children's physiology, admission to PICU, whether subsequent breakthrough seizures occurred and days admitted to hospital. In measuring the effects on the children's physiology, their we will calculate heart rate, respiratory rate and mean arterial pressure from during CSE to immediately post-ictal period. This will be done by subtracting the first measurement as the child presented to the unit from the first measurement taken immediately after the child had stopped convulsing.
 Data analysis During the analysis, the investigator performing the analysis was blinded to which protocol the patients children were allocated to. Group allocations will only be unblinded after statistical analysis is completed and verified by an external party. Data will analysed using SPSS Statistics (IBM Corp. Released 2016, Version 24.0. Armonk, NY: IBM
 Corp). Statistical measurements will be performed using both SPSS Statistics and GraphPad
 Prism version 6.0 (GraphPad Software, USA). For continuous data normality will be established using the Shapiro-Wilk test and thereafter parametric (i.e. paired or unpaired student's t-tests) or nonparametric tests (i.e. Mann-Whitney U test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test) will be performed. Normally distributed data will be reported as mean standard deviation. Data that is not normally distributed will be reported as median with the interquartile range (IQR). Categorical data will be summarized in contingency tables with differences between groups being identified using the Fisher-exact or chi-squared (X2) tests and associations calculated using odds ratios (OR). Significance will be defined as a p < 0.05."

 Introduction: Fall with head injury is becoming an epidemic challenge especially with the ageing population. Contributing factors for mortality and poor functional outcome included development of cerebral contusion and delayed traumatic intracerebral haematoma. There is a higher prevalence especially with the increasing use of antiplatelets and anticoagulants.
 Non-invasive monitoring such as near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is sensitive in detecting intracranial changes. The role and efficacy of this non-invasive method has not been specifically established in patients with head injury as an initial non-operative monitoring.
 This is particular important in the setting of a general ward in which nursing staff is limited. The advantages of these non-invasive monitoring might have a role of continuous neuro-monitoring. They can also potentially reduce the number of unnecessary repeated CT
 Brain in the context of limited radiology staff and resources.
 Timely detection and treatment of this condition accordingly is crucial. Potential options of non-invasive monitoring such as near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is to be investigated.

 - Secondary outcome including number of CT scan performed, correlation of NIRS reading with
 Glasgow coma scale (GCS), rate of intervention with either medical treatment such as use of mannitol, Transamin or blood product transfusion, or surgical treatment such as operation, 30 days mortality and functional outcome at 3 months.
 Purpose and Potential:
 Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) can offer continuous neuro-monitoring. This is particular important in the setting of a general ward in which nursing staff is limited. This allows early detection of delayed haematoma for early intervention. At the same time, the use of
 NIRS can potentially reduce the number of unnecessary repeated CT Brain in the context of limited radiology staff and resources."

 The current study is explorative with the primary aim to find and relate distinct subject metabotypes reflecting tolerance/intolerance to specific food components among IBS-patients by deducing and relating OMICs data patterns (metabolomics and gut microbiota data) to reported severity of IBS-symptoms indicated by the primary endpoint variable, i.e. IBS-SSS.
 Since the investigators don't have an estimation of the variation in the multivariate
 OMICs-data (both metabolomics and 16S rRNA analysis of bacterial RNA), it is not possible to perform an adequate power-calculation. There is a lack of consensus on how to best perform power analysis for these OMICs-designs (and therefore also a lack of tools), although some initiatives have been published. Power analysis is especially difficult in untargeted metabolomics, where the number of variables are not a priori determined, where there is strong multi-colinearity and where variables cannot be assumed to contribute with equal power to effect size. Moreover, there is a shortage of relevant untargeted metabolomics and microbiota study material on IBS x diet interactions from which to estimate relevant parameters such as multivariate effect sizes and variance estimates, due to the surprisingly few metabolomics studies on IBS and the total lack of publicly available raw data. However, significant differences in the metabolome was previously observed in children with or without diarrhea-dominant IBS (n=22 per group). Systematic differences were also shown in individual metabolites in persons with IBS consuming either a high or low FODMAP diet (n≈20 per treatment).
 In this study, a cross-over design will be performed, which will increase the power compared to parallel designs. Moreover, participants will be stratified with respect to subtype of IBS (i.e. diarrhea, constipation and mixed). However, the investigators will not know in advance how many IBS-metabotypes will be present in the material or the quantitative distribution between the metabotypes. Therefore, 120 participants will be recruited to be able to observe significant differences between dietary treatments, based on the assumptions that it will be possible to identify around 4±1 metabotypes, and an approximate equal distribution between metabotypes (≥20 persons per metabotype). In addition, a selection of 120 participants will, under these conditions allow for 20% drop-out from the study, which is a high estimate based on our previous experience from nutritional interventions. An important secondary outcome from this study material is that it will give the opportunity to be used for power calculations in future OMICs-studies where the effect sizes on both clinical parameters and
 OMICs-measures are uncertain.
 Discovery of IBS metabotypes Identification of metabotypes will be performed using predominantly multivariate data analytical techniques. During initial analyses, molecular phenotype data (metabolomics and microbiota) will be analyzed using unsupervised principal component analysis (PCA) and clustering techniques to investigate whether data self-aggregates into meaningful clusters. To adjust for between-individual variability and focus on the effects of interventions, variance partitioning (sometimes referred to as ANOVA decomposition) by individual will be performed. Clusters will be correlated with recorded
 IBS/clinical data (IBS-SSS, bowel emptying diary) to examine whether emerging clusters contain functional information in relation to IBS symptoms. Moreover, it is likely that different clusters are not similarly reflected in plasma and fecal metabolomics and fecal microbiota. To investigate to which extent the different clusters are associated with the different omics blocks, a series of techniques for subdivision of variability into common and distinct components will be applied to the unsupervised analysis.
 In a second line of unsupervised analysis, PCA and clustering analyses will be performed on molecular phenotype aggregated with IBS/clinical data, which will have the potential to influence clustering directly instead of investigating correlations afterwards. Again, subdivision of variability into common and distinct components will be applied to examine how clusters are reflected in the different data blocks.
 Finally, supervised analyses will be used to directly associate molecular phenotype data (independent variables) with IBS/clinical data (dependent variables) using in-house developed partial least squares (PLS) and random forest (RF) techniques. These in-house techniques are specifically adapted to identifying the most relevant set of independent variables to describe the covariability with the dependent data (submitted manuscript). IBS/clinical data can be used both as continuous multiple variables or directly by converting observations to clusters. To examine how clusters and IBS/clinical data are reflected in the different omics blocks, newly developed procedures to find common and distinct components in supervised analysis will be applied (submitted manuscript).
 The progression in these three approaches represent an increasing degree of supervision in multivariate analysis. After all analyses, emerging clusters from the PCA and clustering analyses and multivariate predictions from the PLS and RF analyses will further analyzed using bioinformatics tools adapted to provide meaningful biological interpretation with the aim to confirm correspondence between clusters and metabotypes.
 Rapid diagnostic test of metabotypes After metabotypes have been identified, multivariate predictive analysis of the mixed gluten/FODMAP exposure will be performed to identify predictive biomarkers of metabotypes. These models will similarly as above be based on in-house PLS and RF procedures using metabolomics data as independent variables and metabotype classification per individual as dependent variable.
 Plasma metabolic profiles will be analyzed regularly up to 4 hours post exposure and two different approaches will be undertaken to address the time-trends in metabolic profiling: In a first approach, time profiles will be converted to areas-under-the-curve per measured metabolite feature through numerical integration. These values will then be used directly as independent variables to give an indication of overall reflection of metabotype on metabolite levels after exposure. However, this direct approach will not be able to take into consideration potential differences in time-trends between metabotypes. Therefore, variance partitioning hyphenated with supervised learning will be used to investigate metabotype x time interactions. This approach will require method development in multivariate analysis, which is currently underway in the R Landbergs research group and expected to be ready and beta-tested during 2018, i.e. before data is available for analysis. This methodology is projected to allow for simultaneous analysis of overall differences in metabolite levels between treatments as well as differences in time profiles, thereby giving information also on the most opportune time points to draw samples for effective prediction of metabotype x."

 RESP-FIT. The RESP-FIT program is a 6-week respiratory muscle strength training intervention adapted from previous respiratory muscle strength training (RMST) training regimens, consisting of 1) five training days/week using combined inspiratory and expiratory muscle training, consisting of breathing in and out against a combine inspiratory and expiratory muscle strength trainer (IMST/EMST), 2) individualized, progress-based text message training reminders and prompts related to timing and intensification calibration, and 3) use of a
 Fitbit for remote monitoring of physical activity and hours slept at night. Similar to other muscle strength training programs, exercises are done at regular intervals during the week (5 breaths, 5 times a day, 5 days a week; the participant will receive graphical illustration of
 RESP-FIT training frequency and intensity achieved, and based on their training regimen, will be prompted and/or reinforced via SMS text messaging). As the use of an accelerometer or remote tracking device alone may affect physical activity, a control group will receive only the Fitbit. This study proposes to assess the feasibility and initial efficacy of RMST by obtaining estimates of variability in fatigue secondary to dyspnea, using a technologically-enhanced RESP-FIT intervention. Our overarching hypothesis is that a training regimen consisting of RMST along with technology-enhanced symptom-tracking will decrease dyspnea, dyspnea-related activity avoidance, and fatigue. Additionally, this application proposes to further develop Smartphone Airway Monitoring System (SAMS) which currently integrates EMA probe questions covering COPD symptoms and preventive care use with the new functions, use in an adult population with COPD, video captured training technique and logging of RMST training sessions. Up to thirty adults with COPD (age over 40) will complete the study and use the SAMS app for 6 weeks in the natural environment. We will evaluate the acceptability, feasibility, adherence, and performance of RESP-FIT + SAMS through quantitative methods to further optimize the app and related study procedures for the next phase of testing (i.e., large scale efficacy RCT)."

 From December 2020 to July 2021, inclusive, we will perform a randomized controlled trial (RCT) across eight subpopulations at CRMC, OH, and UCSF. The subpopulations which will be included in the trial are: Cardiology, Gastroenterology (GI), Intensive Care Unit (ICU),
 Medicine, Oncology, Surgery, Transplant, and Emergency Department (ED). All aims of this study across both phases including the RCT have been approved by the Pearl Institutional
 Review Board with a waiver of informed consent (IRB00007772, FWA00026887).
 During the study period, all patients over the age of 18 presenting to the emergency department or admitted to an inpatient unit at the participating facilities will automatically be enrolled in the trial if they are a member of one of the eight subpopulations of interest in this study, until the target enrollment for the study is met.
 Enrollment will entail randomization to either the control or the experimental arms. Patients will be assigned to the experimental group or control group based on a random allocation sequence, generated by a computer program before the start of the trial, using simple randomization, with a 1:1 allocation ratio. This allocation sequence will be concealed to patients, healthcare providers and study investigators. However the trial will have an open-label design, as full blinding is not possible as some group assignments will become naturally revealed upon receipt of telephonic alerts.
 There will be two arms in the study. The control arm will involve patients monitored by the original version of InSight, and the experimental arm will involve patients monitored by the subpopulation-customized version of InSight. In both arms, if the applicable algorithm determines a patient to be at high risk for severe sepsis, a telephonic alert will be sent to the charge nurse on duty in the patient's current location. Response to alerts will follow the protocol from our previous sepsis clinical trial. The procedure consists of a nurse conducting a patient bedside evaluation to rule out suspected infection. This includes assessment of patient vital signs, EHR notes, and recent laboratory results. If the nurse suspects severe sepsis, a physician subsequently assesses the patient and, if appropriate, places an order for administration of the standard sepsis treatment bundle.
 In the administration of clinical trials, some open-label studies are cluster-randomized while others are randomized at an individual patient level. Cluster randomization is frequently used to minimize contamination between treatment and control groups, because exposure of providers to patients from both arms in an open-label study often invites unintentional behavioral biases. These biases may cause providers to adjust their interventions in the control group to mimic their actions in the experimental group, thereby masking the intervention's effect and skewing the study results towards the null. Although open-label, cluster-randomized trials are effective in minimizing contamination among groups, they have several significant disadvantages, including greater complexity in design and analysis as well as larger patient enrollment requirements to achieve the same statistical power. Because larger sample sizes often necessitate increases in cost, length, or complexity of a trial, current research has indicated that trialists should use individual randomization if possible due to the drawbacks of cluster allocation. Given these considerations, we concluded that individual randomization was the best strategy for our trial, as it affords a significant amount of increase in statistical power and allows each patient outcome to be assessed independently of every other patient. To minimize possible bias, we also decided to make the automated phone call text identical in both arms. The successful use of patient-level randomization in our previous sepsis clinical trial gives us confidence in this trial design.
 After the discharge of the last enrolled patient, we will evaluate whether the primary endpoint of in-hospital SIRS-based mortality and secondary endpoints of in-hospital severe sepsis/shock-coded mortality, SIRS-based hospital length of stay, and severe sepsis/shock-coded hospital length of stay are met. Additional outcome measures of interest for each SIRS-based and severe sepsis/shock-coded patient groups will include: time to completion of each element of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) bundle; ventilator-free days; ICU days; and 30-day hospital readmission rate. The 1-hour SSC bundle consists of obtaining blood cultures, measuring lactate level, administering broad-spectrum antibiotics, administering 30 mL/kg of crystalloid fluid for hypertension or lactate >4 mmol/L, and applying vasopressors if patient is hypotensive during or after fluid resuscitation.
 Patients will be considered SIRS-based and included for primary endpoint analysis if they meet two or more SIRS criteria at any point during their stay. The reason for this inclusion criteria is that the algorithm may detect severe sepsis before it is apparent in the chart, and therefore sepsis may be resolved with early intervention prior to severe sepsis documentation in the medical record. For example, if a CDS alert results in treatment initiation before organ dysfunction indicative labs are drawn, the patient's state of severe sepsis may be censored out. Limiting inclusion criteria to the 2001 consensus (Sepsis-2) severe sepsis definition criteria or the Sepsis-3 criteria would exclude such patients from analysis; however, such censorship will be avoided with our use of SIRS-based inclusion criteria.
 We plan to draw from EHR-based clinical data for primary endpoint analysis, as opposed to claims-based data, due to its ability to provide more objective measurements on patient outcomes. However, to compare to other studies that use coding-based inclusion, claims data will be used in inclusion criteria for secondary endpoints. Patients will be considered to be documented severe sepsis/septic shock-coded and included for secondary endpoint analysis if they meet either Angus implementation criteria or any of the following diagnosis codes: R6520 and/or R6521 with septicemia codes A400, A401, A403, A408, A4101, A4102, A411, A412, A413,
 A414, A4150, A4151, A4152, A4153, A4159, A4181, A4189, A427, A021, A227, A267, A327, A5486,
 B377. The use of explicit ICD codes alone for tracking sepsis is known to have high specificity but low sensitivity.
 At the conclusion of the study, significant findings will be published as scientific papers."

 Most ALS patients survive less than 5 years after diagnosis, and the main cause of death is respiratory failure. The investigators are interested in the therapeutic potential of acute intermittent hypoxia (AIH) for individuals with neuromuscular diseases, such as ALS. More than two decades of research indicates AIH elicits meaningful respiratory and non-respiratory motor recovery. Acute intermittent hypoxia (AIH) consists of alternating periods of breathing mildly hypoxic (lowered oxygen concentration) and normoxic (normal oxygen concentration) air.
 The investigators propose to study mechanisms of respiratory plasticity associated with a single presentation of mild AIH. The fundamental hypothesis guiding this proposal is that even a single AIH trial improves respiratory (and non-respiratory) motor function in ALS patients procedure. Participants will then be asked to breathe air with reduced oxygen for short periods of time, for a duration of 30 minutes. The activity of your muscles and your heart function will be monitored throughout the procedure."

 Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death around the world. In 2008 there were nearly 1.6 million new cases worldwide, accounting for the 12.7% of all new cancer diagnoses.
 Despite decreasing trends in smoking and resulting decrease in lung cancer mortality, the population at risk for lung cancer continues to be large. In the past years several programs have been developed to screen for lung cancer using low-dose chest computed radiography (CT).
 However, only recently different studies demonstrated a clear reduction in mortality. In particular, NLST low dose CT screening trial demonstrated a 6.7% reduction in the death rate compared to chest X-ray with a positive screening test rate for lung cancer detection of 24.2%, compared to 6.9% for conventional X-ray. Digital tomosynthesis (DTS) is a limited angle tomography that allows reconstruction of multiple image planes from a set of projection data acquired over a relatively small angle of X-ray tube movement. Although it does not have the spatial depth resolution of computed tomography, it provides high-resolution images in the sagittal planes at a lower dose and cost than CT. Several studies have shown that DTS offers advantages over conventional chest X-ray and comparable of those of CT. The Studio
 OSservazionale (SOS) was a clinical trial conducted within Santa Croce e Carle Hospital analysing smokers and former smokers aged 45-80 with no cancer diagnosis. All the subjects in whom a suspicious nodule was detected by DTS underwent diagnostic CT. The SOS study demonstrated that baseline DTS detected pulmonary abnormalities in 14.5% and lung cancer in 1.0% of the subjects, comparable to results that are obtained in CT screening programs. A second DTS, within the same study, executed one year later reported pulmonary abnormalities in 0.7% and lung cancer in 0.3% of the subjects."

 Patients harbouring tumours with functional O6 methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) DNA repair enzyme efficiently repair the DNA damage inflicted by Temozolomide and gain limited benefit from this chemotherapy. Bortezomib depletes the MGMT enzyme, restoring the tumour´s susceptibility to Temozolomide, if the chemotherapy is administered in the precise schedule when the MGMT enzyme is depleted. Additionally, Bortezomib inhibits the growth of tumour cells by blocking autophagy flux. Temozolomide causes genotoxic stress in cancer cells that in turn respond by inducing protective processes such as autophagy. If both autophagy and
 MGMT DNA repair enzyme are blocked a priori, the efficacy of Temozolomide will be enhanced.
 Thus, pre-treating the tumour with Bortezomib prior to administration of Temozolomide leads to DNA repair enzyme depletion and blockade of autophagy-induced survival signals. The combined effect will sensitize the tumour to therapy, improve chemotherapy efficacy and prolong patient survival outcomes.
 Hypothesis: Pretreatment with Bortezomib administered prior to Temozolomide will sensitize recurrent GBM with unmethylated MGMT promoter to standard TMZ in palliative setting.
 Objective:
 -  Assessment of safety and tolerability of Bortezomib administered with Temozolomide.
 -  Determining the optimal dose of TMZ, when administered as combination therapy
 -  Estimate the progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of patients with recurrent or progressed glioblastoma after pre-treatment with Bortezomib prior to combination with Temozolomide.
 Key secondary objectives
 -  Tumour response to the therapy assessed by RANO and NANO criteria
 -  Determine physiological, molecular and biochemical changes in blood and tumour tissue that correlate with treatment responses."

 BACKGROUND: Current literature on fall prevention for community-dwelling elderly who are at risk of falling suggests that: 1) either single, multicomponent or multifactorial interventions are effective at preventing falls; 2) elderly at risk of falling with
 Parkinson's Disease (PD) and previous Stroke, although having an even greater risk of falling, are often excluded by these interventions; 3) often, present screening methods for risk of falling do not allow the early identification of subjects at risk before the first fall.
 AIMS
 -  To compare the efficacy of an interdisciplinary multicomponent and personalized multifactorial intervention aiming at reducing falls in comparison to the usual care, in a sample of community dwelling elderly, with or without Parkinson's Disease and/or previous Stroke, within the context of an RCT.
 -  To improve the accuracy of screening tests for risk of falling by using wearable inertial sensors.
 -  To develop a reduced set of clinical and instrumental indicators, to be utilized as a quick and reliable screening tests in outpatients clinics.
 METHODS: multicenter, randomized controller trial, with blind assessments on pretest, postest and on one-year follow-up.
 POPULATION: community-dwelling elderly (aged ≥65 years) with age-related or neurological condition-related (Parkinson's Disease and/or Stroke) risk of falling.
 INTERVENTION: interdisciplinary multi-component (group-based exercise; home-based exercise; increasing knowledge/education; home safety interventions) and personalized multi-factorial interventions (assessment and treatment of individual fall risk factors) CONTROL: structured information about participant's own personal risk factors given to the family doctor.
 OUTCOMES: The primary endpoint is the fall rate at one year in both groups. The secondary endpoint is the fall risk at one year.

 TITLE 10 day concomitant versus 14 day hybrid regimen as first line H. pylori eradication treatment in a high clarithromycin resistance area. A multicenter, randomized, equivalence trial.
 INTRODUCTION
 Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a global human pathogen implicated in the pathogenesis of prevalent and serious diseases mainly peptic ulcer disease and gastric malignancy.1 Recent guidelines propose H. pylori eradication every time that it is found with the usual detection methods.2 Successful eradication largely depends on the choice of antibiotics in which the microbe is mostly sensitive.3 Usual first line therapies contained a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and two antibiotics, clarithromycin with amoxicillin or metronidazole when amoxicillin wasn't indicated.4 Eradication rates have been initially acceptable reaching over 80% in per protocol analyses.5,6 However in late years H. pylori has developed an increasingly high resistance profile which has reached over 20% in most European countries, including ours. As a consequence, eradication rates with triple regimens declined to percentages less than 80% in per protocol analyses.7-9 Currently acceptable schemes include the already known bismouth containing quadruple regimen and the non bismouth quadruples namely concomitant, sequential and hybrid.10,11 In our country the 10 days concomitant regimen presents stable and high eradication rates which are significantly better than the standard triple and sequential regimens of the same duration.12-14 In two recent studies concomitant had a significant advantage over sequential on metronidazole resistant strains as well as on dual resistant to both clarithromycin and metronidazole strains.14,15 The hybrid regimen is the less studied first line regimen in Europe.16 In a recent study, on a Greek population, a 14 days hybrid regimen achieved encouraging results and the only predictive factor for failure has been dual resistance.17 To date there hasn't been any comparative study between 10 days concomitant and 14 days hybrid regimens.16
 PURPOSE OF STUDY We designed an equivalence trial between the 10 days concomitant and 14 days hybrid regimens in a Greek population. Our primary outcome is to compare total eradication rates between these two regimens in intention to treat and per protocol analyses. Secondary outcomes are to compare eradication rates in respect to genotypic and phenotypic resistance profiles, the effect of antibiotic resistance on therapy, patient's compliance, adverse events and economic evaluation of the two regimens.
 PATIENTS - METHODS
 Patient selection Patients of 18 years or older with dyspepsia / or iron deficiency anaemia, referring for upper GI endoscopy and found to be infected with H. pylori (positive rapid urease test), naïve to H. pylori eradication treatment, will be invited to participate in the study. Exclusion criteria are: age below 18 years, presence of severe co-morbidities (i.e. liver cirrhosis, renal failure, haematological, neurological, psychiatric, cardiovascular or pulmonary disease), previous gastric surgery, gastric malignancies, Zollinger-Elisson syndrome, known allergy or other contraindications to the study medications, previous H. pylori treatment, use of antibiotics , bismuth salts , NSAIDS or aspirin in the preceding month, use of PPI in the preceding two weeks and not willing to participate in the study.
 Pregnant or lactating women will also be excluded.
 Study Design The study will be prospective. Upper GI endoscopy including two antral biopsies for rapid urease test (CLO-test) will be performed at each patient. In patients tested positive two additional specimens (from the antrum and corpus) will be sent to a reference laboratory for culture and antibiotic susceptibility tests. In cases with indication for histology or equivocal CLO-test results, at least two specimens will be taken from the antrum and corpus respectively, to confirm H. pylori gastritis using haematoxylin-eosin and modified
 Giemsa staining. In equivocal cases an immunohistochemical method can be used. Patients tested positive by urease test and/or histology will be allocated to either treatment group.
 Every patient will sign an informed consent in order to participate in the study.
 Additionally, a careful medical history will be obtained and complete clinical examination performed (including appropriate blood or other tests if indicated) prior to inclusion into the study.
 Participants will be randomly assigned, in a 1:1 basis, to one of two treatment groups namely concomitant and hybrid. Randomization will be organized centrally by an independent assistant investigator using a computer-generated randomization method, using a block size of four.
 This will produce a separate number for each patient sealed in an opaque envelope and kept in his office throughout the study. After obtaining informed consent, the investigators would call the research assistant to open the envelope for the allocated regimen. All data will be inserted in a computer database and elaborated by the participating investigators. The trial is not blinded for patients and recruiting physicians, regarding treatment regimen, as in most randomized controlled H. pylori eradication trials.
 Interventions
 After the confirmation of H. pylori infection, eligible patients randomly assigned to either concomitant or hybrid treatment group will receive:
 -  Concomitant for 10 days, including 40 mg of esomeprazole bid, amoxicillin 1g bid, clarithromycin 500mg bid and metronidazole 500mg bid.
 -  Or Hybrid for 14 days, including 40 mg of esomeprazole bid and amoxicillin 1g bid, for the first 7 days followed by esomeprazole 40mg bid, amoxicillin 1g bid, clarithromycin 500mg bid and metronidazole 500mg bid, for another 7 days.
 Esomeprazole will be given before and antibiotics after meals, in both regimens. In the post-treatment period, symptomatic patients will be allowed to use antacids on demand.
 Antibiotics or other medications interfering with the treatment results will be prohibited during the study period. Efficacy of treatment will be evaluated 4-6 weeks after completion of antibiotic therapy by 13C-urea breath test (13C-UBT) performed according to the standard
 European protocol. In patients requiring a follow-up endoscopy due to peptic ulcer disease, persisting or recurring symptoms, the diagnostic test of choice will be histological examination of four samples taken, in pairs, from the antrum and from the corpus and stained by modified Giemsa.
 Tolerability and adherence Side effects of treatment will be assessed on a structured clinical interview with a specific questionnaire completed immediately after the end of eradication therapy and at the final re-evaluation. During the interview, patients will be asked to grade the severity of each adverse event experienced as mild (transient and well tolerated), moderate (causing discomfort and partially interfering with common everyday activities), or severe (causing considerable interference with patients' daily activities).18 Incapacitating or life-threatening complications will be classified as serious and will be reported to regulatory agency (National Organization of Medicines). Adherence to treatment will be assessed by providing all patients with a pre-structured printed table with all dosages illustrated, asking to tick each time a pill was consumed and bring it back along with any tablet not consumed, for pill counting. In case of discrepancies found between the structured printed table and residual medication, the latter will be taken into account to evaluate patient's adherence. Poor adherence is defined as <90% of the total medication taken.
 Culture and antibiotic susceptibility tests Isolation of clinical H. pylori strains H. pylori clinical strains will be isolated from gastric biopsies. All biopsies will be placed in thioglycollate medium (Oxoid, Basingstoke, UK) and will be sent to the Laboratory of Medical
 Microbiology (Hellenic Pasteur Institute) for H. pylori isolation within 2-4 hours after endoscopy. Following addition of sterile glass beads, biopsy samples will be vigorously vortexed and 100μl of homogenate will be cultured for up to 7 days, at 37°C under microaerophilic conditions (CampyPak-Plus, Becton-Dickinson, Cockeysville, MD), on Columbia agar plates containing antibiotics (vancomycin 10μg/mL, trimethoprim 10μg/mL, polymyxin B 104
 IU/L, amphotericin B 2μg/mL, nalidixic acid 10μg/mL, bacitracin 30μg/mL and fluorocytosine 5μg/mL), supplemented with 8%v/v horse blood and 1% v/v Vitox (Oxoid, Basingstoke, UK).
 Culture sweeps, as well as individual colonies will be collected and frozen at -80°C, until used.
 Antibiotic susceptibility testing Antibiotic susceptibility testing of H. pylori will be performed utilizing E-test strips (BioMerieux, Marcy l'Étoile, France), according to the manufacturer's instructions, on Mueller Hinton agar medium (Beckton Dickinson) supplemented with 10% horse blood. Briefly, agar plates will be freshly prepared and used within 7 days following their preparation. Bacterial inoculum will be prepared from a 1 or 2 day old culture and bacterial suspension will be adjusted to McFarland 3 turbidity (approx. 108 colony forming units-CFU/mL). E-test strips will be applied with sterile forceps to the dried agar surface, following application of the bacterial inoculum and plates will be incubated at 37°C under microaerophilic conditions. Results will be read at 72 hours. MIC clinical breakpoints used to define resistance according to EUCAST will be: clarithromycin (>0.5 mg/L), levofloxacin (>1 mg/L), tetracycline (>1 mg/L), metronidazole (>8 mg/L) and amoxicillin (>0.12 mg/L). To detect genotypic resistance to clarithromycin and levofloxacin a real time PCR will be implemented in cultured H. pylori strains.
 Sample size calculation The study is designed to prove or reject equivalence between the two eradication regimens under study namely 10 days concomitant and 14 days hybrid (equivalence trial). Based on the results of previous studies eradication rates over 85% in intention to treat and over 90% in per protocol analyses have been found for both regimens.17 According to international statistical rules (FDA) two regimens are considered equivalent when the confidence intervals of the difference between their eradication rates do not exceed 15%.
 Using the Monte Carlo (500 X 500 runs) simulation system and taken into account that in the existing Greek studies14-16 eradication rates for hybrid regimen are between 86 and 90% in intention to treat analysis we calculated a sample size of 150 patients in each treatment arm (with a 10% drop out rate) in order to get an 80% power in the study.
 Statistical analysis Comparisons of proportions will be done using the chi-square test.
 Continuous non-parametric data will be compared using the t test. Stepwise multivariate logistic regression analysis will be performed to evaluate factors influencing H. pylori eradication in patients who had a final treatment outcome with either concomitant or hybrid therapy."
NCT03587831,208004,2018-10-25T00:00:00Z,Clinical Trial Description,208004,AACT,"
 The pilot study proposed in this protocol will determine whether patients with a BMI of 30-39.9 kg/m2 will consent to liver biopsy, accept randomization to VSG, participate in lifestyle modification for a one-year period and consent to a paired liver biopsy at 12 months. Sixty candidates will be biopsied with 42 randomizations within the first year yielding 19 (including drop outs) participants/group. This should be sufficient to further estimate meaningful differences in liver histology given the estimated weight loss of lifestyle modification with and without VSG and a correlation of percent weight loss and histological score improvement over the short term (12 months). Determining the impact of the
 VSG is essential for expanding the traditional indications for bariatric surgery and thus, broadening the potential impact of this pilot study.
 We will screen patients by telephone between the ages of 40 and 67 with a self-reported BMI of 30-39.9 kg/m2, a history of prediabetes, or type 2 diabetes. We will ask prospective participants to provide a copy of their most recent liver chemistries to see if the AST or
 ALT fall in the inclusion range. We will screen for a history of alcohol or other substance abuse and a surgical history that would preclude a safe VSG. Prospective participants will be invited to attend a seminar. They will be instructed to keep a food and exercise log for two weeks and return for a second visit. After consent is signed, during the eligibility review period participants will have their height and weight recorded, history reviewed, liver function tests, HbA1c, a urine sample, a basic metabolic profile, and INR will be obtained at this time and the participant will be referred for a liver biopsy. If the biopsy is consistent with NASH with a NAS >=5, then the participant will undergo MRI assessment and serum markers for inflammation. Vital signs (pulse, temperature, respiration, blood pressure, weight and BMI) will be obtained at each study visit. Participants will then begin an 800 calorie per day diet for 7 days during which they will receive their randomization assignment to VSG or not; all participants will receive lifestyle modification as we need to see if surgery can provide any additional benefit to lifestyle modification. A basic metabolic panel will be performed at the conclusion of the 800 calorie diet. VSG will be performed laparoscopically and the greater curvature resected 6 cm for the pylorus to the angle of His over a 40 French Bougie. Lifestyle modification can begin immediately after surgery, though the VSG participants will not have calorie limits until 6 months after surgery. Participants will be seen regularly by the hepatologist and surgeon at 1 week, 4 weeks, 12 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months. Lifestyle modification will be overseen by Nancy Sherwood, PhD.
 Lifestyle will be delivered on an individual basis once per week for the first 6 months, twice per month for the next 3 months, and monthly up to one year (see specifics in study narrative). Vitamins A, B1, B12 and D and a comprehensive metabolic panel including liver chemistries will be performed at 3 months and 12 months in both groups. At 12 months a repeat liver biopsy will be performed (participants will have the opportunity to select an alternative approach if they did not have a good experience with the initial liver biopsy in order to ensure a paired specimen). This decision will be made in conjunction with the interventional radiologist. MRI for steatosis and elasticity will be performed and serum inflammatory and fibrosis markers will be obtained at 12 months as well as collection of another urine sample. Participants will exit the study but will continue usual care after 12 months. We will create a biorepository for stool samples to measure the microbiome and for remaining liver tissue to measure the transcriptome.
 Participants meeting study entry criteria are randomized with equal probability to one of two study groups: (1) Lifestyle modification (LSM) or (2) Vertical Sleeve Gastrectomy (VSG + LSM) with Iifestyle modification, followed for 12 months. The primary goal for the trial is to determine if we can recruit, randomize, and retain participants to perform invasive and non-invasive measurements of NASH and fibrosis, deliver lifestyle modification and demonstrate safety of VSG. We wish to also understand which of these two interventions is more effective in achieving, 12 months after entry into the trial, a reduction in NAS composed of the non-weighted scores: (1) steatosis 0-3 (2) Inflammation 0-3 and (3) ballooning 0-2. Secondary goals include comparing the two treatment groups for changes in other measured outcomes including MRI assessments of intrahepatic triglyceride and liver elasticity and serum markers. As a pilot study a sample size of 19 in each group should offer significant information as to the difference in NAS score reduction between to two groups and to achieve adequate power to distinguish clinically significant changes in the primary and secondary outcome measures. These data support the overarching objective i.e. to provide evidence that a larger, longer-term clinical outcomes trial is feasible. A goal is for a longer term follow up for 5 years to assess the durability of treatment effects and treatment differences."

 The use of the surgical mask has well-known benefits for both the patient and the professional regarding the control of infection contamination. However, its use is left to individual criteria, and is passed on from generation to generation of nurses through experiential, intuitive knowledge. Studies are necessary to support the use of the surgical mask.
 Research indicates that wearing the mask affects perception of words, thus influencing patient-nurse communication. However, it might also affect the very nurse--patient relation.
 For example, it can convey the idea of personal distancing, which can either be appreciated by patients as dutiful professional care by the nurse, or viewed as a limit imposed on interpersonal communication and on the relationship.

 ProbioSatys™ is a probiotic nutritional solution containing a commensal Enterobacteriaceae food grade strain, Hafnia alvei 4597. The microbiome is known to play a crucial role in body weight management and metabolic disease. ProbioSatys™ mechanism of action relies on bacterial metabolites that send local and central signals via the gut-brain axis by molecularly mimicking satiety hormones involved in appetite regulation.
 Numerous ProbioSatys™pre-clinical studies indicate that consumption of the strain leads to body weight loss based on food intake reduction, but also improvement of body composition (increase of lean mass/fat mass ratio), and improvement of glucose metabolism (oral glucose tolerance test, and fasted glycemia).
 The present study aims to evaluate the effects of ProbioSatys™ on body weight and related parameters in overweight subjects during a 12-week consumption period. In addition, tolerability and safety of ProbioSatys™ will be assessed."

 Hypothesis The investigators hypothesize that on-site case-based focused low-dose high-frequency hands on training of maternal and neonatal health care providers and community health workers will have an impact on reducing perinatal mortality rate (PMR) in comparison to MNCH refresher training in a classroom setting.
 Primary Aim To evaluate the effectiveness of an on-site case-based focused low-dose high-frequency training strategy in a primary health care facility labour room, during the provision of care to mothers and newborns, through childbirth and within seven days post-partum for the healthcare providers and the community health workers linked to the health facility in decreasing perinatal mortality.
 Secondary Aims
 To determine if introduction of an on-site case-based focused low-dose high-frequency training methodology in comparison to MNCH refresher training in a classroom setting reduces:
 -  Perinatal morbidity incidence
 -  Post-partum Hemorrhage
 To determine if introduction of an on-site case-based focused low-dose high-frequency training methodology in comparison to MNCH refresher training in a classroom setting increases ENC practices:
 -  Early initiation and exclusive breast feeding
 -  Thermal protection (prevention of hypothermia)
 -  Clean cord care
 -  Delayed bathing
 -  Resuscitation-Initiation of breathing
 To determine if introduction of a case-based focused low-dose high-frequency training methodology in comparison to MNCH refresher training in a classroom setting for CHWs decreases:
 -  Delayed Identification of danger signs during pregnancy, labour and perinatal period
 -  Delayed referral of complicated cases during pregnancy, labour and perinatal period
 To determine the cost effectiveness of a case-based focused low-dose high-frequency training methodology in comparison to MNCH refresher training in a classroom setting
 Methodology
 The study is designed as a facility based, cluster randomized, pragmatic, intervention trial.
 It will be conducted within the country's existing health care system. Specifically, the intervention is a comparison between 3 training modalities; (i) MNCH refresher training in a classroom setting (MoH Mali) and clinical audits followed by on-site case-based focused low-dose high-frequency training of health care providers, (ii) clinical audits followed by on-site case-based focused low-dose high-frequency training of health care providers and (iii) a control group receiving only the MNCH refresher training in a classroom setting (MoH
 Mali) of health care providers. The standard MNCH refresher training will be delivered by government trainers as per CRC planned program in Koulikoro region and the on-site case-based focused low-dose high-frequency trainings will be delivered by MoH trained trainers employed by SickKids and retrained on case-based focused low-dose high-frequency trainings and clinical audits (Figure I: RCT Flow Chart). Analysis will be intention to treat (ITT), taking into account the clustering of observations.
 Randomization
 Cluster Definition
 A cluster is defined as the population residing in the catchment area of the CSCom and the stratification will be at the CSCom level. The primary health care facility (CSCom) provides basic maternal and newborn care services; catering to a population group (5000-10000) residing within a 10-15 Km radius. A community health worker is assigned to 1500 people (approximately 250 households) dispersed across up to 3 villages and provides services in areas 5Km or more away from a CSCom.
 Randomization of clusters will be performed by an epidemiologist not directly involved in the research project and who is therefore unbiased regarding the randomization. Due to the nature of the intervention, blinding is not possible, however to ensure reduced measurement bias, data on the effect of the intervention will be collected by independent data collectors not involved in the intervention delivery. Randomization will be performed at the health facility level (primary health care facility-CSCom, catering to a population group of 5000-10000, residing within a 10-15 Km radius).
 Study Setting The study will be conducted in four districts- Koulikoro, Kolokani, Banamba and
 Dioïla of Koulikoro Region, Mali, within the CRC MNCH program area with a 4-year timeline: 2016-2020. Koulikoro region was chosen because of high perinatal mortality and morbidity indicators; however, these districts were also chosen for study logistics and administrative reasons; Mali Red Cross has a strong presence here due to projects involving strengthening of: CHWs and volunteers for MNCH related activities at iCCM sites. Political stability and availability of population and health facility assessment data from a CRC program baseline survey in 2016 were also taken into account.
 Koulikoro Region is the second-most-western region of Mali. It covers an area of 90,120 km2.with an estimated 2009 population of 2,418,305 and a density of 26.83 people per square km of land area. Mali's estimated birth rate is 42.91 per 1000 population (World Bank 2015) and the region of Koulikoro has an estimated perinatal mortality rate of 30 per 1000 live births with 49 % of births taking place at the CSCom level (CRC HHS 2016). Koulikoro region is separated in seven cercles: Kati, Kangaba, Koulikoro, Kolokani, Nara, Banamba and Dioïla.
 CRC/MRC program area encompasses the latter five. Of these, four districts (Koulikoro,
 Kolokani, Banamba and Dioïla) will be included in this study (Figure II: RCT Districts
 Profile).
 Field operations for the study will be managed and coordinated by Dr. Moctar Tounkara,
 L'Université des Sciences, des Techniques et des Technologies de Bamako (USTTB), Mali.
 Phase I: Study Duration The first phase of the study will be 6 months in total (July-December 2018) during which on-site case-based focused low-dose high-frequency trainings will be undertaken in 56 CSComs (Intervention Arm I and II). All facility births and any newborn referred to the health facility within 7 days of birth (irrespective of the place of birth) during phase I will be included in the final analyses. Data collection during this phase will commence two weeks after the first round of clinical audits and on-site case-based focused low-dose high-frequency trainings. Simultaneous data collection will occur in the 28 control
 CSComs. The timeline of the study can be seen in Figure IV: Timeline of the Trial.
 Phase II: Study Duration The second phase of the study, which will focus on the collection of mortality and morbidity data (see section 16 for further details), will begin in January 2019 and extend for a total of 12 months. Therefore, approximately 17-18 months of births (30,000 newborns, based on 2016 CSCom births) will be included in the final analysis (Phase I and II combined). There will be a 3 month period to analyse the data and prepare the final report (Jan-March 2020). The timeline of the study can be seen in Figure IV: Timeline of the Trial.
 Eligibility Criteria and Enrolment Study Population Eligibility All CSComs within participating clusters (CRC program area) with facility deliveries, perinatal referrals and affiliated community health workers will be eligible for enrollment in this study.
 Enrolment
 -  Approval from the Ministry of Health Mali and the Regional Directorate of health,
 Koulikoro will be obtained to enroll CSComs in target districts providing basic obstetric and neonatal care and affiliated CHWs in the study.
 -  Key personnel from Regional Directorate of health, Koulikoro, will be oriented on the proposed operational research intervention.
 -  Subsequently the study team members will visit all eligible CSComs and share the letters of approval from the MoH and regional directorate with the facility in-charge to formalize the enrollment.
 -  All consenting women delivering a baby in the health facility will be enrolled in the study.
 -  All facility births and newborns referred to a health facility within the perinatal period with consenting parents will be enrolled in the study.
 Intervention Arms Pre-Intervention Training (part of CRC/MRC project) Two maternal and neonatal health care providers from each CSCom in the Intervention Arm I will receive the
 MNCH refresher training in a classroom setting on AMTSL, ENC and PNC. The CHWs in
 Intervention Arm I and II will receive the MoH Mali iCCM and health education trainings in a classroom setting.
 Intervention Arm I- Clinical audits and on-site case-based focused low-dose high-frequency trainings (detailed below).
 Arm II- Clinical audits and on-site case-based focused low-dose high-frequency trainings (detailed below) Case-based focused low-dose high-frequency Training of HCPs and CHWs The intervention is a cluster level on-site case-based focused low-dose high-frequency training strategy offered to health facility staff providing basic obstetric and neonatal care and to community health workers providing maternal, neonatal health education, identification of danger signs for pregnant females during pregnancy and labour, newborns during delivery (home deliveries) and perinatal period, stabilization and timely referral.
 Clinical Audits
 In Mali, it is currently mandatory to notify maternal, perinatal and neonatal deaths/adverse events within 48 hours through the Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response Network; and to convene an audit of the same within 15 days of notification. These audits are being implemented throughout the country by the MOH and; will serve as the platform for the identification of cases for the case-based focused low-dose high-frequency trainings.
 An audit committee comprising of health facility manager, basic obstetric and neonatal care providers and district/regional Health department representative will be formed (as per MoH
 Mali Guidelines-Annex I). An audit meeting will be convened bi-weekly facilitated by the intervention trainer.
 All audit case summaries will be discussed in detail, identifying causes of death, complications and assessing the quality of care provided. The findings will be evaluated against existing service delivery standards/protocols. The clinical audit will identify knowledge deficit among health care providers, knowledge-to-action gap, and training requirements.
 A biweekly mortality audit calendar will be developed for the 56 intervention CSComs (12 audits per CSCom over 6 months). For the intervention arms, MoH trainers, trained on the implementation of the intervention, will participate in the audits, facilitate the process and identify key areas for on-site case-based focused low-dose high-frequency training, mentoring and supervision of MNCH care providers.
 A health facility representative designated by the audit committee will be responsible for providing audit support that includes providing medical records and supporting documentation to audit committee (Annex II), assisting in the development of process, procedural walk-throughs, and responding to various inquiries to assist the committee with the development and documentation of their work papers. Data from the patient's hospital record and CSCom DHIS2 will be used to compile mortality and morbidity audit documents and each case to be audited will be anonymized (Date, Time Patient and HCP identities), and summarized by the health facility representative nominated by the audit committee.
 Factors external to the CSCom services which adversely affected patient outcome (such as delayed recognition of danger signs during pregnancy/labour with delayed referral, delayed recognition of danger signs during perinatal period with delayed referral) will be identified during the audit. These gaps will be addressed through case-based trainings of the community health workers at the corresponding CSCom.
 The summary of each audited case will have a section to document action points for proposed trainings and managerial support, the same will also be recorded in the minutes of the audit committee meeting.
 Following the audit committee meeting, the intervention trainer will stay on at the health facility for one more consecutive day to implement case-based focused low-dose high-frequency trainings to the CSCom staff providing basic obstetric and neonatal care and to community health workers linked to each CSCom.
 This intervention will align with the existing MoH Mali program and not change the existing schedule of service delivery and training curricula (AMTSL, ENC, PNC, MoH-CHW Training) at the CSCom or for the CHWs. This approach will facilitate later scale-up of the proposed training strategy within the existing program in other districts of Koulikoro.
 Control Arm:
 As per MOH-Mali, directive clinical audits are to be implemented in all health facilities in the Koulikoro region, but there will be no on-site case-based focused low-dose high-frequency trainings resulting from the findings of these audits in the control arm during study duration. The CSCom staff and CHWs in the control area will only receive the MNCH refresher multi-method classroom trainings planned as part of CRC/MRC project. Two maternal and neonatal health care providers from each CSCom in the control arm will be trained on AMTSL,
 ENC, PNC, and the CHWs in iCCM and health education.
 Health Facility and CHW Statistical Record All health facility staff and CHW's in the intervention and control arms will receive training on data collection and recording, in an effort to improve HMIS data quality, as part of the CRC/MRC planned program in Koulikoro region. HCP's and CHW's in both the intervention and control sites will receive this training prior to the initiation of the study.
 Study Trainers:
 Intervention trainers (11) will be selected according to the following criteria: 1. Obstetrician, Gynecologist or a General Duty Physician experienced in Obstetrics 2. Preferably resident of the intervention district 3. Previous experience with mortality audit process would be preferred
 Intervention trainers will be trained on case-based focused low-dose high-frequency training strategy for Active Management of Third Stage of Labour (AMTSL), Essential Newborn Care (ENC), Postnatal Care (PNC), identification of danger signs for pregnant females during pregnancy and labour, newborns during delivery (Health facility and home deliveries) and perinatal period, stabilization, timely referral and facilitating maternal and perinatal mortality/morbidity audits by Master Trainers (MoH Mali/SK).
 After completion of training, the trainers will visit assigned CSComs and conduct: 1. An introductory orientation meeting with the facility staff and CHWs on the proposed trial for approximately an hour. 2. A 2 day training on the processes of team building, and clinical audit for an interdisciplinary team comprising of the health facility manager, maternal and neonatal health care providers.
 Implementation of maternal and perinatal mortality and morbidity audit at the CSComs will commence two weeks after this initial visit.
 Logistics Data collectors Independent local data collectors (10) having completed secondary education will be hired and will undergo 5 days of formal training (5 data collectors will cover 8 CSComs and 5 will cover 9 CSComs each). As part of this training, data collectors will gain an in-depth understanding of all data collection forms and verbal autopsy process.
 Data collectors will conduct observed interactions (respondent interview) with a real mother having a live newborn as part of their training.
 Data Collection Informed consent will be taken from all participants in the study and it will be made clear that eligible participants are under no obligation to participate in this study. In addition, the time burden associated with being involved in this study will be clearly outlined during the consent process.
 A record of implementation and frequency of clinical audits conducted will be maintained in intervention arms I, II and control arm for the complete duration of this study- July 2018-December 2019. i) Data collectors will visit CSComs in the intervention and control clusters once a month and after taking consent from the facility manager will collect data from the health facility record (labour room register, maternity ward register, DHIS2) for all deliveries pertaining to PPH, maternal deaths, still births, perinatal deaths, and complications related to labour and delivery for both the mother and newborn since her/his last visit. The data collector will also create a list of facility stillbirths and perinatal deaths with names and addresses for subsequent verbal autopsies (VA) after the 40-day bereavement period. ii) In case of a still birth or neonatal death; an adult (husband/relative) will be tactfully requested to propose a convenient time and venue for the respondent interview that will be conducted by a data collector. The parents/relatives will be given the choice of whether or not a verbal autopsy can be performed around the events surrounding the stillbirth or death of the newborn (VA occurs 40 days after the death). Further details on the verbal autopsy are included in section 20. iii) The data collector will also conduct a follow-up home visit for all CSCom births and referrals in her/his catchment area and administer a short questionnaire (Questionnaire Form
 II-Annex IV) after taking consent from the parent/caregiver of the newborn after day 8 post-birth to capture any complications/adverse events and current status of the newborn. If the mother or caregiver is unavailable at the time of the home visit, the visit will be rescheduled to the earliest available time. If the newborn is not alive, the data collector will leave after recording the date, time and if possible the probable cause of death and return after the 40 day bereavement period to conduct a verbal autopsy. Further details on the verbal autopsy are included in section 20.
 For newborns who do not complete their study visit on or after day 8 post-birth, all available data from the health facility record will be collected in order to ascertain the maternal and perinatal outcome (mortality and morbidity during perinatal period). iv) The parents of a newborn who was not delivered in the CSCom but was referred to it within 7 days of birth will be administered the household questionnaire by the data collector on or after day 8 of life.
 The intervention trainer will collect audit attendance and content data (Annex VI): 1. Audit date, time, participants and their roles 2. List of issues discussed and training needs identified 3. Summary of trainings conducted with dates following the audit 4. List of trainees (HCP/designation and CHWs) 19) Field Supervision and Quality Control An In-country project team composed of a study manager and coordinator with the help of 4 field-monitoring officers will coordinate project activities. . The project team will also be responsible for all the logistics and monitoring support of project activities in addition to oversight.
 Field supervisors will be responsible for ensuring quality control in data collection as well as maintain close liaison with the CSComs and communities. They will also be responsible to randomly back check the CSCom and field data as part of quality control in data collection. They will also ensure timely and accurate electronic data transfer from field to the study coordinator. The study manager will have overall responsibility for the on-ground management and supervision of the trial.
 Data Safety Monitoring A data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) will be convened with three individuals, Dr. Lisa Pell, The Hospital for Sick Children, Professor Ibrahim
 TEGUETE, Obstetrician Gynecologist, USTT, Mali and, Professor Mariam SYLLA pediatrician,
 USTT, Mali with expertise in the clinical area of the trial. The DSMB will have the mandate of making an independent, fully informed assessment of the progress of the trial. It will make recommendations to the trial PI as to whether to continue, amend or terminate the trial. The DSMB will be provided de-identified data at 6th and 12th month of data collection. The identity of study groups will be masked unless the DSMB determines that the identities of the groups are necessary for their decision making.
 The DSMB may also make recommendations / escalate issues to the REB at SickKids (primary organization) and Comité d'éthique de la Faculté de Médecine, de Pharmacie et d'Odonto-Stomatologie de Mali (FMPOS).
 The investigators will adopt a stopping rule for harm (higher than probability of higher mortality in the intervention arm) based on Bayesian probabilities estimated during interim analysis at the following times (t) mid-point (8 months) and again at 12 months of trial duration (post intervention rollout (+0.5 months). The investigators will use a skeptical prior for the Bayesian analysis, a distribution that attempts to formalize the belief that treatments are unlikely to be different. The trial is going to be stopped at time t if D(t) is at least equal to 95 percent. D(t) is the predictive probability that the survival function in the intervention group is smaller than the survival function in the placebo group at time t.
 Function / Responsibilities of the DSMB:
 -  Assess and monitor the trial from an ethical perspective
 -  Assess the quality and completeness of interim data
 -  Review recruitment and participant retention data
 -  Review protocol and deviations from the Standard Operating Procedures
 -  Review any individual events considered significant
 -  Make recommendations regarding trial continuation, amendments or termination
 -  Assess the need for stopping the trial prematurely based on strong evidence of unintended harm or external evidence for all or any of the following: 1. Failure to adhere to the research protocol and non-compliance with goals for recruitment and retention. 2. Any factors that might affect the study outcome or compromise the confidentiality of the trial data (such as protocol violations, unmasking, etc.); and, c) Factors external to the study such as scientific or therapeutic developments that may impact participant safety or the ethics of the study.
 Ethical Approval, Consent Process, Confidentiality, and Safety Ethical Approval The study proposal will be submitted for ethical approval to Comité d'éthique de la Faculté de Médecine, de Pharmacie et d'Odonto-Stomatologie de Mali (FMPOS), and the Research
 Ethics Board at The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada. Subsequent to this approval, consent and agreement to participate will be obtained from the regional and district health departments of Koulikoro, Kolokani, Banamba and Dioïla in Koulikoro,
 Mali.
 Participant Consent Written consent will be obtained from mothers and/or fathers of newborns at the follow-up household visit and also for verbal autopsy. If the mother is not able to give consent, her husband or other adult family member present will be requested to give consent to participate in the study. If the respondent cannot read, the consent statement will be read to her/him and a thumb impression by the respondent in place of a signature will signify consent. The data collector will explain risks and benefits to potential enrollees before conducting the verbal autopsy and administering the household questionnaire in intervention and control clusters. Participants will be informed that they have the right to withdraw from the study at any time and that there are no penalties from doing this and this will not in any way affect their ability to receive any health care services.
 Ethical issues and Benefits The questionnaires will be designed to minimize the length of the interview, as the mother may be interviewed twice; at the follow up household visit on or after day 8 post-birth and in case of a verbal autopsy, thus, disrupting her routine.
 Culturally appropriate time interval (40 days) will be observed before approaching the family for a verbal autopsy in case of a stillbirth or perinatal death. The respondents will be able to skip any questions they are not comfortable with answering and stop the interview if they do not want to continue with it. The clinical audits and trainings will be conducted in such a way that the health care providers and community health workers do not feel vulnerable or persecuted in any way.
 Verbal Autopsy After the notification of a baby's death during the perinatal period, the data collector will make a home visit 40 days after the death. The parents will be given the choice of whether or not a verbal autopsy (Annex V) can be performed on the events surrounding the death of the newborns. If both parents are present, the verbal autopsy will be administered to the mother. If parents are not present, the data collector will ask if one of the parents will return home and be available for the interview within 24 hours. If a parent will not be available within 24 hours, the data collector will administer the verbal autopsy to an adult immediate relative who may be present (in order of priority: adult sibling to the deceased; grandparent; aunt or uncle to the deceased; cousin to the deceased). Consent will be obtained from whichever family member is the subject of the interview and if consent is obtained, they will be requested to answer the questions to the best of their personal knowledge. The data collector will explain that participation in the verbal autopsy is voluntary and that the respondent may choose to answer all, some, or no questions and may choose to stop the interview at any time without consequence. Observance of a 40 days grievance period between the death of a newborn and administration of the verbal autopsy will be mandatory for the data collectors due to local norms. The primary investigator and the co- primary investigator in this study have experience with the use of verbal autopsies associated with maternal, neonatal and child mortality related to obstetric causes. There are no known psychological or social risks associated with the verbal autopsy, additionally there is minimal potential for increased time-burden to the parents as a result of participating in the verbal autopsy. The verbal autopsy will be administered in the home of the respondent by a trained data collector and will take approximately 30-40 minutes to complete. Verbal autopsies will be administered in cases of perinatal deaths and stillbirths for newborns delivered in the CSComs and for newborns delivered at home but referred to a CSCom within the perinatal period. Each completed verbal autopsy will be independently reviewed by two local physicians and a cause of death will be assigned by them. If the two physicians do not assign the same diagnosis, a third physician (adjudicator) will review the two causes of death and assign a final cause of death."

 Sepsis represents a significant burden to the healthcare system. National predictions estimate 751,000 cases of severe sepsis per annum which will increase at a rate of 1.5%.
 Sepsis accounts for >$23 billion in aggregate hospital costs across all payers and represents nearly 4% of all hospital stays. Six percent of all deaths in the US can be attributed to sepsis. Protocol driven care bundles improve clinical outcomes but require early and accurate detection of sepsis. Unfortunately, identifying sepsis early remains elusive even for experienced clinicians leading to diagnostic uncertainty.
 To improve diagnostic consensus, a task force in 2016 agreed upon a new sepsis definition.
 The task force also included a new risk stratification tool to improve early identification, the quick Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) model, which was more accurate than the older Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) in predicting adverse clinical outcomes. However, due to the reliance of end organ dysfunction, the new definition has been criticized for its detection of sepsis late in the clinical course. Clinical decision support tools based on predictive analytics can provide actionable information and improve diagnostic accuracy particularly in sepsis.
 Several early warning tools have been described in the published literature based upon predictive analytics and large datasets. One example is the National Early Warning Score (NEWS), which was developed to discriminate patients at risk of cardiac arrest, unplanned intensive care admission, or death. Scores such as NEWS are typically broad in scope and not designed to specifically target sepsis. They are also conceptually simple, as they use only a small number of variables and compare them to normal ranges to generate a composite score. In assigning independent scores to each variable and using only the most recent value, they both ignore complex relationships between the variables and their evolution in time.
 In previous work, our group developed a framework to model multivariate time series using multitask Gaussian processes, accounting for the high uncertainty, frequent missing values, and irregular sampling rates typically associated with real clinical data can be read in our prior work. Our machine learning approach is superior to other sepsis detection models that use traditional analytics and machine learning techniques. A custom web application, Sepsis
 Watch, presents the risk score along with relevant patient information and prompts the user to further evaluate the patient and begin treatment, if appropriate. The Sepsis Watch system is now being implemented by clinical operations at Duke University Hospital.
 Our study employs a sequential roll-out study design in the Emergency Department at Duke
 University Hospital. Our study will involve pods A, B, C, and the Resuscitation Bay. The operational project is not being implemented on the psychiatry wing, fast track, triage or any inpatient encounters. The operational project and thus our study period is based upon a two-phase roll out:
 -  1st arm: The predictive model notifies the rapid response team through a dashboard.
 Nurse notifies team of the risk for sepsis and provides treatment recommendation to primary team and primary team will place orders. Rapid response team nurse documents assessment and actions taken in electronic health record.
 -  2nd arm: The predictive model notifies the rapid response team through a dashboard. The rapid response nurse notifies team of risk and will themselves place orders. Afterwards the rapid response nurse will notify the primary team. Rapid response team nurse documents assessment and actions taken in electronic health record.
 In addition to observing patient outcome measures, we propose an additional mixed-methods study component to obtain richer information about the effects of the early warning system on clinicians' situational awareness, decision-making, and workflow. This part of our research will involve (1) gathering data from clinicians through a series of semi-structured interviews, surveys, and observations (2) analysis of this data and identification of relevant patterns and insights. Relevant clinicians include include rapid response team nurses, emergency department (ED) nurses, and ED physicians. These interviews will be conducted in three rounds over the implementation period: before the 1st arm, after the 1st arm, and after the 2nd arm. Electronic surveys will be administered at the end of the 1st arm and the 2nd arm to clinicians. The observations will take place during the 1st and 2nd arms.
 The goal of the interviews, surveys, and observations will be to (1) evaluate the effect of the early warning system on the clinicians' situational awareness and decision-making, (2) understand how the early warning system fits into clinician workflow, and, (3) identify opportunities to improve the implementation of the early warning system for future scale-up.
 We will be structuring interviews according to the situational awareness model which differentiates between 3 levels of situational awareness: 1) perception of relevant information, 2) comprehension of that information, and 3) anticipation of future events based on that information. Through the interviews, observations, and surveys, we also hope to learn more about clinicians' perceptions of and interactions with the early warning system, and its change on the existing Emergency Department workflow for sepsis diagnosis and management.
 Data analysis will be conducted with the help of trained qualitative researchers from Data &
 Society, a research institute in New York City that is focused on the social and cultural issues arising from data-centric technological development."

 The study aims to investigate if Imatinib reduces intracerebral haemorrhage and oedema in stroke patients after IV thrombolysis and/or trombectomy. Two important complications of ischaemic stroke and its acute treatment are haemorrhage into the infarcted tissue and cerebral oedema. Leading to worsening functional outcome in survivors. Both are caused by a disruption of the blood brain barrier (BBB) by ischemia of the brain vascular endothelium and associated cells involved in maintaining the BBB. Imatinib can reduce the damage to the BBB and hence reduce the formation of oedema and haemorrhage.
 The study is a phase III randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled parallel-arm trilal of patents with acute ischaemic stroke. Assessing the Clinical variables at baseline and after 3 months.
 Primary objective:
 To investigate if Imatinib (800 mg / day) treatment initiated within 8 hours of symptom onset and given for 6 days improves functional outcome at three months after acute ischaemic stroke
 Secondary objective: 1. Investigate if Imatinib treatment improves functional outcome at three months in acute ischaemic stroke patients treated with iv thrombolysis 2. Investigate if Imatinib treatment improves neurological outcome at three months after acute ischaemic stroke 3. Investigate if Imatinib treatment improves neurological outcome at three months in acute ischaemic stroke patients treated with iv thrombolysis 4.

 The prevention of Type 2 diabetes in an obese person with prediabetes requires developing a healthier lifestyle. The rational approach for someone with prediabetes would be to eat healthier, be more active, lose weight, and manage their comorbidities. However, preliminary research suggests that individuals with Type 2 diabetes discount the future and engage in behaviors that maximize current pleasure and short-term gain; thus, daily choices needed to improve future health are rare in this population. Delay discounting (DD) describes the choice of smaller immediate versus larger delayed rewards. This behavioral process is related to a wide variety of health choices, ranging from preventive health to behavioral and medical regimen adherence, including regimens used for Type 2 diabetes. The investigators believe that DD provides a target for one type of self-regulation that can improve a wide variety of health behaviors and medical adherence.
 Research from our laboratories has shown that episodic future thinking (EFT), a form of prospection which reduces the bias towards immediate gratification, activates brain regions involved in planning and prospection such that future rewards have increased value and the extent of delay discounting is reduced. Cueing individuals to think about future events during inter-temporal decision-making reduces the rate of DD, eating in and outside of the laboratory, and smoking behavior. The overarching goal of this research is to use an experimental medicine approach to translate basic research on DD and EFT into clinical interventions to prevent the transition from prediabetes to a diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes."

 Breast cancer remains the most common cancer in women worldwide, with approximately 1.68 million new cases, and 0.52 million deaths, annually. Meanwhile the incidence of breast cancer continues to increase. Although regular clinical examination, mammography, ultrasonography, and magnetic resonance imaging can detect some recurrence patients, the lack of robust biomarkers for monitoring of anti-tumor therapies and detection of recurrence reduce the treatment effectiveness of current strategies for breast cancer.
 Semaphorin4C (SEMA4C) has been previously identified as a highly expressed protein by breast cancer-associated lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) using in situ laser capture microdissection of lymphatic vessels, followed by cDNA microarray analysis. Moreover, membrane-bound SEMA4C is cleaved by matrix metalloproteinase (MMPs) to release a soluble form of this protein. The study is undertaken to explore SEMA4C's potential role as an early relapse biomarker in breast cancer."

 NSABP FB-13 is a phase II, open label study to examine the biological and clinical effect of neoadjuvant endocrine therapy with letrozole, palbociclib and ovarian suppression in premenopausal patients with estrogen-receptor (ER) positive, HER2-negative, early invasive breast cancer.
 Premenopausal women newly diagnosed with ER-positive/HER2-negative early breast cancer who are suitable candidates for neoadjuvant endocrine therapy will be invited to join the FB-13 trial. A screening Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score® will be performed by Genomic Health,
 Inc. (GHI) on the diagnostic tissue of consenting patients to verify eligibility.
 Patients will be stratified into one of two approximately equal sized cohorts based on baseline Breast Recurrence Score (RS) (cohort 1: patients with RS less than 11 or cohort 2: patients with RS 11 to less than 26).
 Patients in both cohorts will receive letrozole 2.5 mg by mouth daily, palbociclib 125 mg by mouth daily for 21 days of a 28 day cycle, and goserelin 3.6 mg subcutaneous injection on Day 1 of each 28 day cycle. At Week 6 of study therapy, patients will have two core-cut biopsies.
 Patients from both cohorts who have a Ki67 less than 10% level will continue receiving study therapy for a total of 6 cycles. Patients with a persistent Ki67 greater than or equal to 10% at week 6 will permanently discontinue study therapy and begin neoadjuvant chemotherapy or proceed to surgery at the discretion of the treating physician.
 Pre-treatment samples and post-surgical samples will be collected and analysed to identify subgroups of patients who may derive the most clinical benefit. The results of the biological analyses may allow a target sensitive population to be selected for future trials. The tissue collected in FB-13 will form an integral part of the primary analyses; so all core biopsies in this trial will be mandated for patients.
 Two core-cut biopsies will be collected from each patient at baseline, after 6 weeks of study therapy, and upon completion of study therapy (24 weeks) at the time of definitive surgery.

 This was a phase 1, single-center study carried out in healthy male and female subjects to investigate the safety, tolerability, and PK of d-methadone. This was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study in 6 sequential cohorts of healthy subjects. Single oral doses of d-methadone were investigated in sequential cohorts. The proposed doses were 5 mg, 20 mg, 60 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, 300 mg, and 400 mg. The decision to enroll the sequential cohort at the next dose level was based on the safety data and available PK data from previous doses. Dose escalation depended on the emergence of dose-limiting AEs and review of the safety data. Progression to the next higher dose only occurred if the previous dose level was deemed to be safe and well tolerated by the investigator, safety review team, and sponsor. Of the 8 subjects in each cohort, 2 subjects received placebo and 6 subjects received d-methadone.
 Subjects were admitted the day prior to receiving the study drug and remained in the clinical research unit (CRU) under clinical supervision for at least 72 hours post-dose. At the discretion of the investigator or designee, the confinement time could have been extended to ensure the safety of each subject. Visits 3 and 4 were follow-up visits approximately 6±2 days and 10±2 days, respectively, after drug administration.
 Based on the blinded safety data from Cohorts 1 to 4, single doses of 5 mg, 20 mg, 60 mg, and 100 mg of d-methadone or placebo were well tolerated and there were no dose-limiting AEs.
 During all cohorts, subjects were evaluated for safety (AEs, vital signs, electrocardiograms
 [ECGs], cardiac telemetry, pulse oximetry, clinical laboratory tests), tolerability, and PK.
 The following signs of opioid toxicity were deemed to be of special interest:
 -  sustained respiratory depression that results in oxygen saturation below 92%
 -  QTc prolongation (>500 ms or >70 ms above the baseline)
 -  protracted nausea and vomiting
 -  any AE deemed by the investigator to be dose-limiting Safety Analysis Safety and tolerability parameters were listed by treatment and subject and displayed in summary tables using descriptive statistics.
 Original terms used to identify AEs were coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory
 Activities (MedDRA), version 17.1. The number and percentage of subjects with treatment emergent AEs (TEAEs) were summarized by system organ class, preferred term, and treatment and for each treatment by maximum intensity and maximum relationship to study treatment.
 Descriptive statistics for vital signs were calculated and presented for each time point by treatment (absolute values and change from baseline). ECG results (absolute values and change from baseline [average of triplicate assessments, where applicable]) were summarized using descriptive statistics; frequencies (numbers and percentages) were calculated for the overall evaluation by scheduled time and treatment. Laboratory data were summarized by the type of test and scheduled visit. Descriptive statistics and number of subjects with laboratory test results below, within, and above normal ranges were tabulated by scheduled time. Abnormal findings in laboratory data were listed with a flag for clinical significance. Medical history abnormalities were coded to MedDRA terms. Physical examination abnormalities were also listed. The original verbatim terms for concomitant medications were coded into drug class and preferred term. These data were listed.
 Pharmacokinetic Analysis The PK parameters for d-methadone determined by non-compartmental analysis were summarized by dose. Graphs of concentration (linear and log-linear) vs time were generated. Descriptive statistics were calculated by dose and time point for all d-methadone concentrations. Concentrations below the limit of quantification (BLQ) were set to zero for the generation of summary statistics and mean concentration-time plots.
 For the calculation of the PK parameters, concentration-time data were treated as follows:
 BLQ concentrations prior to the first quantifiable concentration were set to zero; BLQ concentrations after the first quantifiable concentration were treated as missing; pre-dose sampling times relative to dosing were set to zero. Descriptive statistics were calculated by dose. The dose proportionality of Cmax and AUC was assessed by the Hummel method. Tmax and t½ for different doses were compared using the Kruskall-Wallis test to determine whether there was any difference among the treatment groups, and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test for contrasts.
 Pharmacodynamic Analysis The PD data at each time point were summarized by descriptive statistics and presented graphically (as appropriate). Derived endpoints were summarized using descriptive statistics.
 Outliers were listed by measure and parameter. Pupillometry constriction was listed and grouped by dose and subject with descriptive statistics for changes from baseline for different time points."

 Approximately one out of three 2- to 5-year-old children in the United States has experienced caries (tooth decay). The American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry and American Academy of
 Pediatrics provide recommendations for preventive strategies, and recognize that infant, toddler and early childhood oral health is one of the foundations upon which preventive education and dental care must be built to enhance the opportunity for a lifetime free from preventable oral disease. Parents struggle to adopt these preventive strategies at the same time that challenging behaviors emerge in children's psychological development. This combination can make it very difficult to build the foundation of oral health practices that the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry and American Academy of Pediatrics recommends.
 There is a strong body of evidence supporting the use of behavioral parenting strategies in dealing with child behavioral problems. The proposed project introduces behavioral parent training strategies in concert with efforts to address other known parental barriers to provide an effective vehicle to promote dental health with a universal prevention intervention.
 This private/public collaboration between Oregon Research Behavioral Intervention Strategies,
 Oregon Research Institute & The Oregon Community Foundation will leverage resources and competencies to create a commercially viable coordinated oral health prevention intervention program to promote dental health targeted at parents of young children attending parenting education classes and families receiving home visiting services through Head Start. The program includes a video that can be shown in parenting education classes to engage parents on oral health and a mobile/web application to drive behavioral change.
 In this Phase I application, the investigators propose developing a coordinated oral health prevention intervention program, BeReady2Smile, including video and mobile/web- application. An initial proof of concept version of this program and reminder set will be developed in the Phase I project and then tested for feasibility/usability among parents of young children. BeReady2Smile will include video content that features demonstrations/content on encouraging brushing, proper loading of toothbrush, brushing duration and frequency, fluoride myths, and limiting sugar sweetened beverages and milk in baby bottles while in bed.
 BeReady2Smile will also include a mobile application built within a web-based infrastructure, so parents can participate in multi-media educational activities, develop dental health behavior plans, tailor features and receive feedback from the system on a secure website. The long-term goal of BeReady2Smile is to help parents provide the foundation for a lifetime free from preventable oral disease."

 Disease activity in RA can be assessed by physical examination, patient-reported outcomes (PROs), or laboratory tests. Joints counts and PROs are partly or entirely subjective. Their ability to support clinical assessment is limited in certain settings, including for RA patients with common comorbidities, such as fibromyalgia, obesity, or depression, or with clinically uncertain inflammatory burden. It can be difficult to assess the origin of ongoing pain in such patients using clinical assessment alone. The two blood tests routinely used to assess RA disease activity, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP), are objective but are in the normal range in more than half of RA patients with active disease, which reduces their negative predictive value and greatly limits their utility.
 These clinical and laboratory measures are variously combined in composite scores of RA disease activity, such as the 28-joint count Disease Activity Score (DAS28) or the Clinical
 Disease Activity Index (CDAI), which are not widely used in the US outside of clinical trials because complete, formal joint counts are time-consuming and composite scores pose logistical challenges in a busy clinic setting.
 Radiographic progression (RP) is a validated endpoint accepted by the FDA for clinical trials that reflects RA-related damage to joints. It is associated with long-term disability.
 Optimal care requires that the risk of progression be reduced. Quantitative scoring of RP is performed only for clinical trials and is not used for assessing RP risk in clinical practice. Rheumatologists are generally not trained to score radiographs and they are very time-consuming to score, typically taking 20 or more minutes per patient for a skilled reader. However, they are a valuable scientific endpoint in that they serve as a valid proxy for long term damage and associated RA-related disability.
 Conventional clinical and laboratory-based measures of RA disease activity are weak predictors of RP, even among patients in clinical remission, where progression can still occur. Thus, an objective, convenient measure that reflects pathologically meaningful disease activity and predicts risk for progression is needed for optimal management of RA.
 The multi-biomarker disease activity (MBDA) test, Vectra®DA, is an objective tool that combines serum concentrations of 12 biomarkers in a validated algorithm to produce a score on a scale of 1 to 100. The Vectra DA score has been shown to be the strongest predictor of risk for RP, compared with conventional disease activity measures, including DAS28-CRP, CRP and the swollen joint count. In multivariate analyses, it was the only disease activity measure to independently predict RP. High Vectra DA scores (>44) are associated with greatest risk for progression and low and moderate scores with very low risk. Across multiple studies,
 Vectra DA has a negative predictive value for progression of 93−97%, and in a meta-analysis, the relative risk for progression with a high Vectra DA score (5.1) is substantially greater than with a high DAS28-CRP (1.4) or high CRP (1.6). The predictive value of Vectra DA exists even when the Vectra DA score and clinical measures are discordant, which means that patients with high DAS28-CRP have little risk for RP when Vectra DA score is low, and, conversely, patients with low DAS28-CRP have high risk for RP when Vectra DA score is high.
 Thus, reducing high Vectra DA scores should be a primary goal of therapy, regardless of the level of clinical disease activity, and using Vectra DA scores to guide therapy should be the most effective way to prevent radiographic progression. A recent prospective study of daily and diurnal variation in Vectra DA score established that the minimally important difference (MID) in Vectra DA score- i.e., the magnitude of change in Vectra DA score that is needed to be confident it reflects real biologic change and is not due only to random variation is ≥ 8
 Vectra DA units. Accordingly, a threshold of 8 should be used in guidances for using Vectra
 DA to evaluate treatment response.
 There is opportunity to gain more information about the utility of Vectra DA in a real-world clinical setting. This study will, therefore, evaluate the utility of Vectra DA for guiding treatment decisions and improving RA-related outcomes in comparison with usual care, which will not include Vectra DA testing. This study will enable a direct evaluation of the clinical benefit associated with using Vectra DA to guide treatment decisions in patients with RA.
 The primary objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of Vectra DA guided-care to reduce annualized radiographic progression from baseline.
 The secondary objectives of this study are to:
 -  Evaluate the rate of radiographic non-progression from baseline to year 1 among patients with RA whose care is guided by Vectra DA relative to those receiving usual care.
 -  Evaluate changes in Vectra DA score from baseline to year 1 among patients with RA whose care is guided by Vectra DA relative to those receiving usual care."

 Anastomotic leakage after pancreaticoduodenectomy is a feared complication with substantial mortality and morbidity. Treatment of a postoperative pancreatic fistula can be difficult and management may range from a simple observation with or without percutaneous drainage, to the urgent need for reoperation and management of abdominal sepsis with organ failure and prolonged intensive care. To diagnose a pancreatic fistula may have a delay of several days.
 The risk of death and severe morbidity raises considerable from a biochemical pancreatic fistula compared to the most serious form, a grade C. Also, the cost of managing a patient with a fistula is 1.3-6 times more than a patient with no complications after PD.
 Microdialysis is a promising tool in patients who undergoes pancreaticoduodenectomy for early detection of postoperative pancreatic fistula development. The technique may reveal an fistula before severe symptoms occur and before the complication gives the patient serious and life-threatening symptoms. Earlier intervention of the postoperative pancreatic fistula may lead to better prognosis, less reoperations and interventions and shorter stay at the
 ICU/hospital. By monitoring intraperitoneal metabolites (glycerol, lactate, pyruvate and glucose) close to the pancreaticojejunostomy, signs of a leakage may be discovered in few hours, thereby make it possible for early intervention and prevent developement of serious progression of morbidity. The investigators want to perform a randomized study where half of the patients will receive a microdialysis catheter implanted close to the pancreaticoduodenal anastomosis before closure of the abdomen. At certain timepoints postoperatively microdialysate will be analyzed for glycerol, lactate, pyruvate and glucose and the data will be used in the decisionmaking of diagnosing a pancreatic anastomosis leakage in addition to standard management. The other half of the patients will not receive a microdialysis catheter and the decisionmaking will only be based on standard management (ie. inflammation markers in blood samples, amylase in drainage fluid)."

 Spinal metastasis is the leading course of vertebral malignancy. It cause neoplastic spinal cord compression and neurological deficit. The treatment strategy depend on the pathological type, performance status, and life expectancy.(1, 2) The goal of treatment is to avoid neurological deterioration, to keep functional life, and to control bone pain. Because disease cure is rarely the treatment goal in the circumstance of metastatic disease, the treatment strategy involve multidisciplinary approaches. When evidence of neoplastic compression, local oncological treatment is often needed to preserve neurological function and to restore vertebral column stability. Radiation therapy can be applied for some radiosensitive tumour, but surgery is often required to meet above goal. Simple decompression and fixation is often applied, but the long-term control rate is suboptimal. Aggressive spinal surgery has relative longstanding effect to maintain neurological and oncological outcome in selective patients. (3)
 Aggressive spinal surgery, including extensive corpectomy, vertebrotrectomy, and even spondylectomy, however, is a massive procedure and may result in large amount, sometime life-threatening blood loss. To achieve better surgical outcome and decrease complication, preoperative evaluation needs understanding the detailed skeleton and vascular anatomy. The status of vertebral column stability, extent of tumour involvement, condition of neurological tissue, and vascularity of the tumoural tissue, are all important in determination of the surgical planning and outcome. In many circumstances, preoperative embolization is often required to control blood loss as well.(4, 5) Imaging plays major role in the above information related to the surgical decision and planning.
 Current preoperative imaging evaluation include MRI, angiography, bone scan and PET. (6) The
 MRI is paramount in the spinal imaging. It provides outstanding soft tissue differentiation, which usually depicting the abnormal tumoural tissue clearly. Therefore, MRI stands central role in the surgical evaluation. Nevertheless, in real world, many patients are frail to tolerate lengthy MRI study period, and the MR imaging quality is often suboptimal. For vascular survey, angiography is capable to demonstrate spinal artery and tumour vascularity.
 Since its relative invasiveness, it is only reserved for patients when preoperative embolization is required or detection of spinal artery is warranted. And because the angiography study for tumour involves selective catheterization of separate segmental artery, the global evaluation of tumoural tissue is not possible. As for nuclear medicine studies, including bone scan and PET, they are highly sensitive and very convenient in detecting multifocal disease. But they are relative non-specific for variable pathology and the spatial resolution is not adequate for surgical evaluation. Therefore, they provide less information when diagnosis has been established.
 CT is an important imaging tool for spinal disease. Because of its rapid acquisition, adequate resolution, and easy reformatting, it is optimal for intolerable patients. (7)
 Nevertheless, osseous structure is extremely radiopaque, evaluation of tumoural enhancement in vertebrae is not easy. It is reserved in special condition, such as detection of vascular structure for embolization and surgery. Recently commercialized dual-energy CT (DECT) can meet the prior result of conventional CT with added value. (8) It uses different energy level simultaneously to image the object. Therefore, optimal bony removal and contrast-noise-ratio can be expected.(9, 10) In spinal disease, it has been used in the detection of marrow edema and compression fracture. (9, 11) On the other hand, material-specific information can be obtained, quantitative evaluation of tumoural enhancement by contrast medium is possible. (12) Along with imaging post-processing technique, DECT can highlight the tumoural part in the background of hyperdense bone. (13) DECT is a promising tool to study the vascularity of the metastatic vertebral tumour. This information is valuable for the surgeon in the decision making and planning for the operation.
 We intend to use the dual energy CT in the preoperative evaluation of the vertebral metastasis before aggressive surgery. The research potential and purposes are manifold.
 First, we want to establish imaging biomarker for tumoural vascularity. Many different enhancement parameters as potential candidate will be measured. Second, we intend to establish one-stop imaging method; therefore, we will compare the diagnostic performance with other imaging modalities. Third, the optimal imaging parameter in the evaluation of bony lesion will be investigated, and many image technical condition will be studied.
 Purpose： 1. To establish the quantitative imaging biomarker for vascularity in metastatic vertebral tumour 2. To obtain the optimal DECT scanning parameter and reformatting method in vertebral osseous tumour 3. To provide detailed anatomical information for embolization and surgery"

 By 2025, it is estimated that approximately 1 million people in the United Kingdom (UK) will suffer from dementia, a syndrome associated with progressive decline in brain function. While there is currently no cure for most types of dementia, early diagnosis can help patients receive the appropriate treatment and support to help maintain mental function.
 The focus of this project is to identify changes in retinal structure associated with dementia. In collaboration with bioinformatics experts at University College London (UCL), we propose to analyse our repository of >1 million retinal scans, termed optical coherence tomography (OCT), performed regularly on patients since 2008. OCT scans will be linked at a patient level to data from the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) database to identify those who have been diagnosed with dementia or went on the develop dementia. Thus, a pseudonymised classified dataset of retinal scans will be generated for qualitative and quantitative analysis. The primary objective is to characterise changes in the layers of the retina associated with dementia. Machine learning techniques may also be employed to identify novel patterns of retinal change associated with dementia."

 Canada has amongst the highest incidence of IBD with current prevalence rates among youth of 13.1 per 100,000 with rates steadily increasing. IBD negatively impacts all aspects of health-related quality of life, resulting in physical challenges (e.g., pain, fatigue), emotional challenges (e.g., stress, anxiety and depression) and sometimes making it hard for children and teens to see friends and attend school. The goal of this study is to find out if the iPeer2Peer mentoring program helps teens with IBD take better care of their illness and feel more connected to other people with IBD. The iPeer2Peer program matches teens with IBD to an older mentor who has learned to manage their IBD well and can support them emotionally and socially. This study will compare two groups of teens: those who are in the iPeer2Peer program and those i the control group (no mentor)."

 Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admissions constitute a major part of hospital activity and resource allocation, and the number of patient days in ICUs and on mechanical ventilation is increasing. More than 5 million patients are admitted to an ICU annually in the United
 States, and approximately 55,000 critically ill patients are cared for each day. The most common cause for admission is respiratory insufficiency or failure; a study of data from 2005-2007 estimated that nearly 40 percent of ICU patients require mechanical ventilation.
 Patients experience frequent emotional and psychiatric complications from ICU stays, including depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder. One 2011 study found a prevalence of clinically significant depressive symptoms ranging from 17 percent to 43 percent among post-ICU patients. In 2013, it was reported that up to 50 percent of patients experience general anxiety symptoms one year after discharge, a rate much higher than in the broader US population.
 Patients who temporarily lose the ability to speak report a high level of frustration. A study of 127 patients reported that, two stressors, being intubated and not being able to talk, were significantly more stressful… than all the other stressors. The mean stressfulness score for [25] other stressors was between no distress and mild distress. Improving subject communication with ICU care team will likely require better technological interventions, and current best practice for assessing the optimal patient communication method is dependent on the evaluation of an experienced speech-language pathologist (SLP). Current approaches are insufficient for patient's needs, as one representative study described: Patients rated 40% of the communication sessions with nurses as somewhat difficult to extremely difficult.
 Assistive communication strategies were uncommon, with little to no use of assistive communication materials (e.g., writing supplies, alphabet or word boards). Designing an effective mode of communication for ICU patients unable to speak due to mechanical ventilation will likely improve patient's experiences and, potentially, long-term outcomes.
 Some limited technologies exist to address these issues; however, they are not in widespread use due to a variety of reasons, including cost, lack of intuitiveness, and design that is not appropriate for the ICU setting. The investigators are designing a technological solution to assist ICU subjects in communicating with their caregivers, particularly nurses. The investigators are planning to do the initial testing of MOCS in the adult ICUs at the
 University of Massachusetts Memorial University Campus and Memorial Campus and at a later time conduct testing at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) in the Neuro ICU and Respiratory
 Acute Care Unit (RACU).
 The purpose of this stage of the project is to determine whether the device that has been designed in the previous study will be suitable for the needs of patients, families, and nurses. The investigators will be measuring duration of use, frequency and type of engagement, and mechanical stability."

 Acute renal injury (AKI) is a common complication after cardiac surgery. In patients undergoing noncardiac surgery, intraoperative hypotension may lead to hypoperfusion of important organs and result in organ injuries such as AKI, myocardial injury, and stroke. The development of organ injuries is associated with wose outcomes including higher 30-day or even 1-year mortality. In a recent randomized controlled trial, patients undergoing major noncardiac surgery received either individualized (systolic blood pressure [SBP] maintained within 10% of the reference level) or standard (SBP maintained above 80 mmHg or within 40% of the reference level) blood-pressure management strategy during surgery. The results showed that individualized blood-pressure management reduced the incidence of postoperative organ dysfunction. Intraoperative hypotension is very common during off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. The investigators hypothesize that, for patients undergoing off-pump
 CABG, good blood-pressure management with norepinephrine may also reduce the incidence of postoperative AKI. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of targeted blood-pressure management during off-pump CABG surgery on the incidence of postoperative AKI."

 The investigator's previous study (Liu & Au-Yeung, 2017; PMID: 28383292) has demonstrated that 1-hour peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) applied to the radial and ulnar nerves of the paretic UL of people with chronic stroke can increase transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-evoked excitability of corticomotor pathways in both hemispheres projected to the contralateral first dorsal interosseous (FDI) hand muscle, and also improve dexterity in the paretic hand. This bi-hemispheric effect of PNS suggests that certain additional therapies such as action observation (AO) and motor training should be incorporated to strengthen the plastic corticomotor adaptation specifically for paretic UL control. The hypothesis of this study is that PNS paired with AO would augment task training of the paretic hand by increasing the corticomotor excitability in the lesioned hemisphere for the trained hand muscle in people with stroke, with associated dexterity function improvement. Twenty subjects were recruited by convenience in the community. They then attended an assessment session to evaluate the baseline sensorimotor status of their paretic upper limb. After the clinical tests，the subjects were introduced the assessment procedure for measuring corticomotor excitability with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). After 1-week intermission, the subjects returned for 3 intervention sessions with different protocols including (1)PNS+AO+Training; (2)PNS+AOsham+Training; and (3)PNSsham+AOsham+Training. These 3 intervention sessions were arranged in random sequence for subjects. For PNS+AO+Training session, electrical stimulation was applied to the radial and ulnar nerve (PNS) of the paretic arm for 60 minutes. During the last 30 minutes of PNS, action observation (AO) was introduced in which subjects were required to watch a series of video clips. After one hour's

 Posterolateral spinal fusion is currently performed by using large amounts of autologous bone graft. Drawbacks of bone grafting include the need for an additional surgical procedure, limited supply, sub-optimal bone quality in osteoporotic patients and harvesting morbidity, which led to the development of numerous bone graft substitutes. Recently, a promising synthetic graft substitute has been developed that has shown favorable results in pre-clinical studies. This product, MagnetOs™ Granules, is CE-marked and received 510(k) clearance from the US Food and Drug Administration. The aim of the current study is to demonstrate non-inferiority of MagnetOs™ Granules compared to autograft in instrumented posterolateral spinal fusion, in terms of efficacy and safety.
 This study is designed as a multicenter, observer blinded, randomized, controlled non-inferiority trial with intra-patient comparisons. A total of 100 adult patients qualified for posterolateral spinal fusion in the thoracolumbar and lumbosacral region (T10-S2) will be recruited and enrolled. According to a randomization scheme, one side of the spine will be grafted with the MagnetOs™ Granules and the other side with bone harvested from the iliac crest and local bone. The rest of the surgical procedure will be according to standard care.
 The primary efficacy outcome is the rate of successful posterolateral spinal fusion after one year, assessed on CT-scans. Non-inferiority of the MagnetOs™ condition compared to the autograft condition will be assessed using a McNemar's test. The primary safety outcome is the number and nature of (serious) adverse events related to the surgical procedure compared to control populations from literature. Secondary outcomes are the comparison to its predicate (AttraX® Putty), relation between posterolateral fusion and interbody fusion after one-year, posterolateral spinal fusion rate after two years, relevance of iliac crest donor site pain and the incidence of long-term complication and relation with risk factors in the combined population of this study and a recently completed clinical trial."

 BACKGROUND
 There have been various forms of collaboration in Norway between community mental health centres (CMHCs), GPs and primary health and social care. But with a lack of research on such models, there is little knowledge on whether they contribute to better health care, outcome and satisfaction, e.g. for the large group of patients with moderately severe mental and comorbid health problems mostly seen by GPs. There is a great need for clearly defined collaboration models and for research-based knowledge of their feasibility and impact in the context of the Norwegian health services.
 Reviews of studies on collaboration show inconsistent results, including insufficient evidence to demonstrate significant benefits from shared care (Smith 2009), modest reductions in primary care consultations and mental health referrals (Harkness 2009), partly improved depression management (Butler 2011), and research primarily on simpler models of collaboration between two professionals (Hviding et al. 2008, Craven et al 2006).
 The Family Health Teams model developed in Hamilton, Canada, is a promising model of shared care (Kates 2011a, 2011b). It is built around GP practices. Each team include one or more
 GPs, nurses, mental health counsellors, a visiting consultant psychiatrist, and some other part-time staff (pharmacist, nutritionist, physiotherapist, occupational therapist). The model has increased access to care for persons with mental health and addiction problems, reduced waiting time, reduced referrals to outpatient mental health services, increased patient satisfaction, improved patient health, improved communication and co-ordination, and increased GPs' confidence and skills in treating mental health problems.
 CONTEXT
 The study is done in three Oslo boroughs (Alna, Grorud, Stovner) with a total population of 108 000. They are served by a total of 85 GPs in GP centers, by the primary health and social care in the boroughs, and by a community mental health center (CMHC), child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) and other departments of the Division Mental Health Services at Akershus University Hospital.
 INTERVENTION
 The intervention is an adapted version of shared care with close collaboration by services and professional groups, mainly localized in three GP centers. At each GP center one clinical psychologist specialist from the community mental health center (CMHC) works two and a half day a week, and a psychiatrist from the CMHC work at each GP center 1-2 hours a week. The psychologist and the psychiatrist are available for the GPs for consultation and discussions, and they give assessment and brief treatment to patients as requested by the GPs. Other primary health and social care and other specialized mental health or substance addiction services are involved or consulted according to needs of the patients.
 The decisions on the adaption of the model were taken by the collaborating services themselves in October-December 2015 after a joint visit to Hamilton by 14 persons and with input from the research group. This secured that the services had ownership and commitment to the model and contributed to make it feasible and useful.
 The shared care in the three experimental GP centers was established during the winter of 2016 and were operational for 18 months from the April/May 2016 to October/November 2017. The implementation was supported by discussions in monthly meetings at each GP center for the professionals collaborating on shared care there, and in monthly meetings at the CMHC between the psychologists and psychiatrists in shared care, managers at the CMHC and the principal investigator of the research study.
 AIMS
 The aim is to study the impact of a Norwegian adaption of the Hamilton Family Health Team model of shared care between general practitioners (GPs), mental health services and other primary or specialised services.

 METHODS
 CLUSTER RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED REGISTER STUDY ON IMPACT OF SHARED CARE
 The study is a cluster randomized controlled study of GP patients and their health care in shared care (experimental group) compared with usual health care (control group). In each of three boroughs one GP center is randomized to have shared care for 18 months while another GP center continues with usual health care. Register data on patients and health care are extracted for 12 months (T0) before the implementation of shared care and for 12 months (T1) with shared care (after 6 months with implementation of the shared care model).
 Retrospective register data on patients and use of services for the two 12 months periods (T0 and T1) are extracted from the GP patient records, Akershus University Hospital (mental health and substance addiction services for adults and youth), and NAV (social/welfare services). Patient cohorts at T0 and T1 include all patients 16-65 years old seen by the 30
 GPs in 12 months. Based on earlier studies each cohort was expected to be 20-25 000 patients.
 In 2014 the 30 GPs referred 840 patients to outpatient mental health clinics and 190 to inpatient mental health wards. Based on this, significant changes in referrals to outpatient clinics (main primary outcome) are expected to be shown by comparing periods of 12 months.
 In the data analyses of the impact of shared care the experimental sites are compared with control sites at T1, as well as with all sites at T0, including a difference-in-difference analysis (research questions 4-6). Data analysis on usual health care at T0 will include descriptive analyses and analyses to identify and compare different patient subgroups or patterns of use of health care in this unique combined data set from the several services for a large group of GP patients (research questions 1-2).
 SUB-STUDY ON PATIENT-REPORTED HEALTH AND SATISFACTION
 Patient-reported mental health, functional impairment due to health problems, overall quality of life and satisfaction with health services are studied for a sub-sample of the register cohort at both T0 and T1. GP patient 16-65 years old are recruited during two weeks at each
 GP center with some assistance from research staff. Included patients give written consent and complete a brief questionnaire in Norwegian or English. Inclusion criteria and secondary outcome measures in the questionnaire are shown in the tables. The sample is a sub-sample of the register cohorts at T0 and T1. To identify a difference of 6 points on the mental health measure CORE-10 between T0 and T1 with 5% two-tailed significance and 90 % power 70 patients per arm is needed in a cluster randomized trial with ICC=0.03 and 12 GPs in each arm (Eldridge 2012, Schultz 2010, Moher 2010). Aiming to recruit 600-750 patients (20-25 per GP) will secure a more than large enough sub-sample for the main secondary outcome measure (CORE-10). Data analyses of patient-reported information will answer research question 3 and parts of research questions 4 and 5.
 QUALITATIVE SUB-STUDY ON EXPERIENCES WITH SHARED CARE
 A qualitative sub-study of experiences with collaboration in general, the shared care model, implementation of the model, facilitators and barriers is done at the end of the 18 months period of shared care. Focus groups are conducted with the GPs in each of the GP centers (experimental and control centers), and individual qualitative interviews are done with approximately 15 patients with experience of shared care, nurses and other co-workers at the
 GP centers, professionals involved with shared care in the primary health and social services, managers at the CMHC and the psychologists and psychiatrist from CMHC working in the shared care. This qualitative study is done in stead of a planned survey with a questionnaire to health personnel, as the number of potential informants would be too small for statistical analyses compared to what was expected when planning the study. Analyses of the qualitative data will answer the research questions 7-9.

 Pain is ranked highest among undesirable clinical outcomes associated with caesarean section therefore postoperative pain relief following a cesarean section is extremely important to optimize maternal and neonate well being. Multimodial analgesics are effective in reducing postoperative pain but analgesia is still not optimized. Opiate based analgesics are effective but having troubling side effects. Addition of non-drug pain therapies hold promise in improving postoperative recovery while potentially allowing for reduced use of drug based analgesics."

 Per current standard of care for patients with breast cancer, three different tracers will be injected in the participants: technetium radiocolloid, indocyanine green and methylene blue.
 Initially, the surgeon will identify the location of the sentinel lymph node per standard of care by using a handheld gamma-probe and by visual inspection of the wound site. While the surgeon is locating the sentinel lymph nodes in the underarm surgical wound site, the investigators will be recording the fluorescent signals from the same site with the bio-inspired multispectral camera.
 All resected tissue from the patient will be imaged with the multispectral camera before sending samples for pathology analysis. Results obtained from the multispectral cameras will not be presented to the surgeon during the surgery in order not to influence their surgical decision."

 Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) affect up to 10% of mother-infant dyads and account for 7.4% of cases of maternal mortality in the United States. Prompt recognition and treatment of hypertension remain one of the key features of management of mothers affected by these conditions. Improving recognition and treatment is of particular importance given that maternal mortality rates continue to rise in the United States. Moreover, mothers affected by
 HDP are at increased risk of long-term morbidity, such as cardiovascular disease, atherosclerosis, and persistent hypertension outside of pregnancy. Therefore, it is critical to recognize hypertension throughout maternity care, including in the postpartum period.
 The postpartum period is a time of major challenges for the new mother and considerable physiologic changes that place the new mother at increased risk of adverse events. For a postpartum woman with a diagnosis of a HDP, the risk of complications extends beyond discharge from maternity care: up to 41% of severe morbidity and mortality from HDP occurs after 48 hours postpartum, as postpartum blood pressures tend to peak 3-6 days after birth.
 For these reasons, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the
 National Partnership for Maternal Safety recommend early postpartum follow-up for women diagnosed with HDP, in the form of blood pressure (BP) evaluation by a health care provider at 7-10 days postpartum. However, barriers to follow-up, including childcare arrangements, transportation access, and recovery from delivery, limit mothers' ability to adhere to this recommended in-office follow-up. Indeed, attendance at postpartum follow-up visits is poor and reflects significant disparities.
 A potential alternative to in-office evaluation is at-home blood pressure (BP) monitoring.
 At-home BP monitoring is a novel, affordable method to empower, educate, and engage postpartum women affected by HDP. This approach is not in widespread use in the US, despite the American Heart Association indicating that home BP monitoring is recommended for all people with high blood pressure. Within the obstetric population, pilot studies have demonstrated the feasibility and acceptability of remote BP monitoring. However, a randomized trial of postpartum at-home BP monitoring compared with office-based follow-up is lacking."

 Postpartum Depression (PPD) is a serious syndrome which resembles a major depressive episode and occurs in 10-20% of all mothers in the year following delivery. In addition, 20 - 30 % of women with Bipolar Disorder will experience postpartum psychosis (mania) and at least 20 % will experience a postpartum depression with some estimates as high as 65%. The postpartum time therefore represents a natural experiment that, in the setting of prospective monitoring, will allow the measurement of biological, genetic, and environmental factors that may impact the development of mood episodes.
 Data was previously collected in A Prospective Study of Postpartum Mood Episodes in Women with Affective disorders. Investigators followed 93 women with a history of a mood disorder (Major Depressive Disorder, Bipolar I, Bipolar II or Bipolar Not Otherwise Specified) through pregnancy and up to three months postpartum. This was a very ill sample and around 75% of the participants met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM)-IV criteria for a Major Depressive
 Episode either during pregnancy, postpartum or both. Of those that were well during the 3rd trimester (N=38), 40% became depressed within 4 weeks of delivery, despite the fact that 80% were taking psychiatric medications. Of those that developed Postpartum Depression, 53% had a family history of Postpartum Depression compared to 12% of those that did not develop
 Postpartum Depression, thus demonstrating a potential genetic basis for Postpartum
 Depression. Using this sample, investigators were able to identify epigenetic biomarkers that were predictive of Postpartum Depressive episodes.
 Investigators now seek to replicate and extend investigators' previous findings by identifying and following a second sample of women with mood disorders through pregnancy and into the postpartum time period and, in addition, collect a sample of pregnant women who do not have a history of mood disorder as a control sample. These women will have psychiatric histories taken and will be monitored throughout pregnancy and during the postpartum period for the development of depressive or other mood episodes. In addition to clinical data, biological measures such as hormone levels, immunological measures and growth factors will be taken. Environmental factors such as sleep deprivation and stress will also be measured.
 These factors will be considered in the setting of genetic and epigenetic data with the hope that investigators will ultimately be able to predict the onset of postpartum mood episodes in this vulnerable population. An understanding of the biological basis of postpartum episodes will ultimately shed light on the vulnerability to Major Depressive Disorder and
 Bipolar Disorder in general"

 According to the requirement of the Strategy of Polio Eradication & Endgame Strategic Plan 2013-2018, bivalent oral attenuated live poliomyelitis vaccine against type 1 and 3 (bOPV) and inactivated poliomyelitis vaccine made by Sabin strain (sIPV) need to be used to eradiation both the wild poliovirus and vaccine-derived poliovirus.
 By studying different sequential immunization schedules of bOPV(candy/liquid) with
 IPV(cIPV/sIPV) to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of bivalent oral poliomyelitis vaccine co-administered with IPV in healthy Infants. A randomized, double blind, single center and parallel phase Ⅲ clinic trial was performed in Guangxi Province in China. A total of 1200 infants at 2 months old were selected, and randomly divided into 12 different groups (100 individuals were included in each group) administrated the vaccines at 0, 28, 56 days schedule. The bOPV(bivalent oral attenuated live poliomyelitis vaccine against type 1 and type 3), tOPV(trivalent OPV against type 1, type 2 and type 3), sIPV (Inactivated

 The process of aging involves numerous structural and functional changes also affecting the skin. The skin fulfills a variety of protective and regulatory functions. Compared to other organs, the skin is constantly exposed to harmful environmental influences. Besides intrinsic factors these external factors may accelerate skin aging. Due to its ageing-related loss of functional capacity the skin becomes susceptible to develop adverse skin conditions and dermatological diseases (e.g. skin dryness, fungal infections). Especially old aged, care depended, and severely ill individuals are at high risk for developing severe skin injuries and wounds (e.g. decubitus, skin tears) with high social and economic impact. Empirical evidence indicates that the reduced adhesion of the dermal-epidermal junction is a major pathophysiological predictor for these types of injuries.
 The suction blister model is an artificial and controlled technique for dermal-epidermal separation along the dermo-epidermal junction (DEJ). Empirical evidence suggests that the time of the dermal-epidermal separation (blistering time) is a measure of the dermo-epidermal adhesion. It has been proposed that the blistering time might be a clinically relevant parameter reflecting the mechanical integrity/stability of the dermo-epidermal junction.
 Clinical practice guidelines recommend the use of topical skin care products to reduce the risk for pressure ulcer and skin tear development. However, the underlying working mechanisms of most basic skin care products are poorly understood. It is known that topically applied skin care products exhibit physical and chemical effects on and in the uppermost skin layers (e.g. the stratum corneum). Despite a few well known active ingredients (e.g. retinoids, vitamin C) exhibiting effects in the dermis, a particular skin protective effect of the vast majority of daily basic skin care applications on these deeper skin layers is unknown. The primary objective of this study is to test, whether the use of a basic skin care formulation increases the mechanical integrity/adhesion of the dermo-epidermal junction."

 Lidocaine has analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects. It has been shown to reduce early postoperative pain and nausea. Additionally, lidocaine has been shown to have positive effects in the recovery of bowel function, with a reduction in time to first flatus, first bowel sounds, first bowel movement, and is associated with a reduction of ileus. Because of these facts, lidocaine infusion has become part of enhanced recovery pathways after bowel surgery at our institution and others.
 There are few trials examining the use of lidocaine for orthopedic procedures and many of these studies have contradictory adults. An article by Martin et al. found no benefit in pain or recovery after total hip arthroplasty. By contrast, Farag and colleagues found that lidocaine significantly improves postoperative pain after major spine surgery. Additionally, quality of life scores at one and three months after surgery were significantly higher in the lidocaine group. When our Spine Surgery Analgesic Protocol for major spine surgery at
 University of Vermont Medical Center was revised in 2015, a lidocaine infusion was added to the protocol.
 Studies for lidocaine use in minor lumbar surgery are scant. In one study of 50 patients in
 Korea, patient pain scores and fentanyl consumption were significantly lower in the lidocaine infusion group (1.5 mg/kg bolus plus 2 mg/kg/hr infusion) at 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24 hours after surgery. Of note, the Cleveland Clinic Outcomes group is currently enrolling 440 patients in a study in which half will receive lidocaine and ketamine infusions.
 A reduction in opioid use may lead to the potential reduction of opioid-related side effects, such as nausea, constipation, and hyperalgesia, as well as more serious consequences such as respiratory depression and abuse. There is also the possibility of a length of stay reduction which has potential financial benefits.
 This is a randomized, controlled, double-blind study involving patients undergoing one- or two-level posterior lumbar instrumented spinal fusion with or without decompression.
 The University of Vermont Medical Center operating rooms will be utilized for this investigation. For the study group, we plan to prospectively recruit 140 patients 18-75 years of age. Recruitment will be done by the participating orthopedists and neurosurgeons, from their own patients. After an informed consent discussion, patients will be randomly assigned to receive 1 mg/kg lidocaine bolus and intraoperative infusion of 2 mg/min (intervention arm) or no lidocaine (control arm). All patients will receive adequate pain control medication according to their needs. Subjects will complete the 15-question Quality of Recovery assessment at baseline and at 36 and 60 hours after surgery. Using the electronic medical system, the following information with extracted: Total morphine equivalent used in house at 36 hours, total morphine equivalents used at 60 hours, visual analog scale pain scores at 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, and 60 hours, length of stay, incidence of nausea requiring medication, time to first flatus, and time to first bowel movement. Subjects will receive a patient-controlled analgesia pump for the first 36 hours after surgery.
 Randomization will be performed by the University of Vermont Medical Center Investigational
 Pharmacy Drug Service (IDS). IDS will generate a table of random numbers and assign those numbers in a 1:1 ratio of active drug to placebo, in blocks of 4. Following informed consent, a member of the study team will notify IDS, which will prepare syringes for the bolus dose and a bag for the infusion, both containing either active drug or placebo. The syringes and bag will be labeled with the subject's name, medical record number, and randomization number."

 Atropine drops are commonly used to dilate the eye and prevent the ability to focus and also slow the progression of nearsightedness. Low concentration (0.01%) atropine slows the progression of myopia 60% to 83% while causing less side effects than high concentration (1.0%) atropine though still showing an effect on pupil size and pupil response.This study is a prospective cohort study in which several objective and subjective measurements will be taken before and after the use of 0.01% atropine for a week to determine the effect of this concentration on 1. vision at distance and near; 2. pupil size; 3. focusing ability, accuracy, and change; 4. symptoms, including subjective vision, headaches, light sensitivity, drop comfort; and 5. pressure in the eye. This will allow us to determine the effect these drops have on the eye and whether or not patients would be willing to use them as a possible preventative treatment for nearsightedness. The investigators expect to find that the drops will not affect vision, will increase pupil size, decrease focusing ability and accuracy (but not clinically meaningfully), cause some light sensitivity, and have no effect on eye pressure. The investigators expect that patients would be willing to use these drops to control nearsightedness even after experiencing the side effects."

 The investigators will recruit 60 adults with typical language (TD) and 40 LI participants through a variety of community and university related contacts. 40 TD adults and 20 LI participants will be enrolled in Experiment 1. 20 TD adults and 20 LI participants will be enrolled in Experiment 2.
 Both experiments will take place over 3 Sessions.
 During Session 1, the investigators will administer various measures in order to validate study eligibility, classify participants into groups, and other measures in order to further characterize our samples. To that end, participants will be administered a pure tone audiometric screening, and complete an interview questionnaire asking for background information such as handedness, language background, language and reading development, and development of motor skills. Trained research personnel will then administer an approximately 2-hour testing battery that includes measures of nonverbal cognition, language ability, reading ability, attention, executive function, and phonological processing. Participants will also complete questionnaires to assess their habitual sleep quality, sleepiness, and individual chronotpyes.
 All testing will be completed by a student clinician, and will be supervised by a certified speech-language pathologist. 100% of administrations will be re-scored by a trained student for accuracy. To account for attrition and non-qualifiers, we anticipate enrolling/screening up to 200 individuals in Session 1 in order to arrive at the enrollment targets for
 Experiments 1 and 2.
 In both experiments, Sessions 2 and 3 takes place on two consecutive days. Session 2 will take place in the late evening, and Session 3 will take place in the morning. We have intentionally chosen not to employ a wake-state (AM-PM) control. This is done in order to limit the potential variability in the amount of English exposure between sessions.
 Between-session sleep duration will be monitored with an Actigraph wGT3X-BT accelerometer (Actigraph, corp) worn on the non-dominant wrist. Actigraphs will be set to collect data in 60-second epochs via a validated algorithm (Cain & Geremia,2011). This method of recording sleep/wake activity has been independently validated to agree with lab polysomnography at 85% accuracy (Slater et al.,2015).
 Experiment 1: behavioral measures During Session 2, participants will complete the three learning tasks, declarative learning, procedural learning, nonnative speech learning (in that order), and immediate post-learning assessments. During Session 3, participants will be re-assessed in nonnative speech learning, declarative learning, and procedural learning (in that order).
 -  Declarative memory will be assessed using an object recognition task following incidental encoding.
 -  A version of the Serial Reaction Time task will be used to measure procedural learning.
 -  Perceptual learning of speech will be measured through performance on identification and discrimination tasks on the dental and retroflex contrast.
 Experiment 2: neuroimaging measures During Session 2, participants will complete the nonnative contrast training in the late evening.

 Participants will be parents of children with a pervasive developmental disorder (autistic spectrum disorder), Down syndrome, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, diabetes mellitus type 1, asthma, and parents of healthy children (without difficulty and chronic disease - control group).
 The investigators will examine the level of stress and quality of life in parents of children with developmental and chronic illnesses, compared to parents of healthy children, adjusting for the effect of confounding factors.
 Data collection will be conducted using the questionnaire to assess personal quality of life, family quality of life, general and parental stress levels. Additionally, potential confounding or mediating factors will be measured and taken into account: stress resilience, cohesion, self-esteem, optimism, perception of happiness, stigmatization, depression, anxiety, sleep quality and parenting challenges. Also, socio-demographics parameters, short medical history, lifestyle habits and the perception of life difficulties will be assessed.
 The questionnaire will be filled by paper-pencil method with anticipated duration of about 45 minutes.
 The investigators will also measure several physiological indicators - salivary cortisol, heart rate variability, blood pressure and Advanced Glycation End products (AGEs).
 Saliva will be taken in order to analyze the cortisol level, using Salivette Sarstedt REF 51.1534.500. Participants will be taken five saliva samples during the day because of the physiological variability of cortisol (first one around 22:00 hours, second right after waking up, then 15, 30 and 60 minutes after awaking). Each subject will receive detailed instructions on how to take saliva, with written instructions. Thirty minutes before sampling, the subjects has to restrain from eating, drinking, smoking or brushing teeth. In case of acute illness, inflammation or disease in the oral cavity, the sampling will be delayed. After taking the sample, tubes will be stored in the refrigerator. In the laboratory, the sample will be centrifuged for two minutes to remove saliva from cotton, and saliva samples will be frozen. Cortisol analysis will be done using ECLIA (Electrochemiluminous Absorption Method).
 The electrocardiogram (ECG) will be recorded using the Medilog AR12 Plus Holter device, which will also be used to record heart rate variability (HRV) during 5 minutes. HRV will also be recorded using the Polar V800 (also during 5 minutes). Kubios software will be used for HRV analysis.
 AGE Reader, a non-invasive device will be used for measuring the autofluorescence in the skin, reflecting the level of Advanced Glycation End products (AGEs).
 Omrom M6 Comfort is an automatic device which will be used to measure blood pressure and pulse.
 Anthropometric parameters will be measured (body weight, height, neck circumference, waist and hip circumference).
 Statistical analysis will be carried out using statistical program MedCalc. Initial analysis of results will include analysis of the distribution of variables using the
 Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. If the distribution of numerical variables will be normal, parametric statistics will be applied. The confounding factors will be controlled by using appropriate statistical tests.
 Participation of parents in this study is voluntary. If a parent decides to participate in this study, the code will be assigned. In that way, all data, measured parameters, and saliva samples will be encoded, and the personal data of the respondents will be completely invisible. It will not be possible to identity an individual parent. All researchers must and will be protecting confidentiality of data."

 Participants and Procedures. Partner Consortium. The PI has strategically chosen four types of partners in order to maximize the sustainability of our training. The study team's multidisciplinarity will increase the potential for reach across domains that are pivotal in changing the landscape of mental health for LGBTI in Romania. First, the team partnered with a multi-service provider, the Romanian Association against AIDS (ARAS), a non-governmental not-for-profit organization founded in 1992 to support the health of hidden and vulnerable groups including LGBTI. ARAS intends to expand the depth and breadth of its LGBT-competency in mental health. Second, the team has received the essential support of academics (Hyperion
 University and Professors Călugaru and Dumitriu), which are forefront agents for social change. Third, individual MHPs in private practice who are connected with key associations have signed on as liaisons to their affiliated organizations (e.g., Bellanima Center for
 Psychotherapy and Psychiatry) to facilitate training participation. Fourth, the team continues its fruitful collaboration with their technical developer, Data Center Solutions (DCS), who built the mobile platform on which the team delivered live therapy for DMDN, collected real-time mental health and behavioral data, and disseminated sexual health materials. DCS is an expert in health systems information technology (medical e-learning; patient health-promotion), and will build our mHealth training platform.
 Inclusion Criteria. 120 Romanian practicing MHPs (psychologists or psychiatrists) or MHPs in training will be eligible to participate.
 Recruitment. The Partner Consortium will advertise the project via web-postings, listservs and eblasts to their national circles. Facebook ads were the most successful source of recruitment for DMDN. The team will thus be able to canvas all regions of Romania. Further, due to the pilot work, the team is maintaining contact with close to 100 MHPs from Bucharest (the capital), and other cities (e.g., Sibiu, Iasi, Cluj Napoca, Timisoara). While they will not be eligible to participate because they had exposure to the program, they will circulate, as indicated by their Letters of Support, future trainings among their circles of individual practice and professional affiliations (e.g., Romanian Collegiate of Psychologists, the
 Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Association of Romania).
 Screening and Consent. Study ads will link to the Qualtrics electronic screener easily accessed from any mobile device. MHPs will take the 5-minute survey (Appendix 2) to determine eligibility, and be randomized to either the MT group or IPT group (based on age and geographical region). The study budgeted travel stipends for one-third of the MHPs, whom the team anticipate live outside Bucharest, such that travel costs will not impede their participation in IPT and to ensure that each group will include samples that are unbiased geographically. Notably, the pilot included non-Bucharest residents. Alternate training dates will be offered for those unable to attend the trainings. Group assignment, training dates, locations, and link to a Qualtrics baseline (BL) survey will be sent prior to the training.
 The BL contains the consent form with our contacts for questions. The team tested these procedures in the pilot, during which the PI answered study questions from MHPs via email.
 Sixty MHPs will be randomized to receive a 2-day IPT in Bucharest, and 60 MHPs will be randomized to the equivalent 3-day MT, on a DCS-designed platform compatible with any mobile device, and with document-sharing and voice-conferencing capabilities. The didactic trainings will be interspersed with answering MHP's questions (voice or text).
 Supervision and Consultation. After the first follow-up (4 months post training), half of the
 IPT MHPs and half of the MT MHPs (n=30 per group, total n=60) will receive 2-hour monthly mobile supervision using a forum format on our mobile platform for 8 months. DCS will design a group chat feature, similar to the one they devised for a previous pilot study. The live monthly supervision will occur on this platform after the 4-month and before the 12-month assessments. This system will provide MHPs with a fully automated and interactive mobile platform through which they will participate in supervision, as well as submit questions and receive answers for case consultation from the experts (Dr. Pachankis and DMDN intervention psychologists) within 48 hours. Further, MHPs will receive case studies through our mobile website, monthly, with response options asking them their best approach to helping the client (e.g., common LGBT stressor situations such as coming out, negotiating sexual safety, reducing isolation, or replacing health-depleting behaviors such as excessive drinking with healthy alternatives). Cases are fully discussed during supervision. At the end of the study, those who did not receive supervision will be given access to all the case studies and the mobile consultation site to achieve equity.
 Boosters. We will hold two 2-hour IPT and MT boosters, respectively, 6 and 12 months post training, and provide an overview of LGBT-affirmative therapy principles, their incorporation into clinical practice, clarifications, and troubleshooting. Case studies will be included covering common issues raised by LGBTI.
 Measures of MHP Attitudes, Knowledge, and Clinical Practice. The mixed-methods design involves qualitative interviews (n=10) and 30-min. self-administered internet-based quantitative surveys (n=120) by MHPs, the latter being administered at BL, and at 4, 8, and 12-month follow-ups. Surveys will be identical and assess, in a mobile fashion, changes in
 MHPs' LGBT attitudes, knowledge of LGBT health needs, clinical practice skills, and LGBT caseload.
 Feasibility and Acceptability. Feasibility measures include data on session attendance.
 Acceptability measures include 5-min. session rating surveys (on mobile devices), and the 10 qualitative interviews.
 Efficacy. MHPs will report their age, gender, specialization, years of clinical practice, and
 LGBT caseload. We will measure attitudes, knowledge and clinical skills; and the presence of explicit and implicit stigma and homophobia."

 Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) targeting cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) and the programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1)/programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) pathway might induce inflammatory potentially serious and even lethal immune related
 Adverse Events (irAEs). Diarrhea and/or colitis are ones of the most frequently reported irAEs in patients taking ICI, occurring after an average of three infusions. The incidence is higher among patients taking combination anti-CTLA-4/ anti-PD-1 therapy (44%) than those receiving anti-CTLA-4 (23-33%) or anti-PD-1 (≤19%) monotherapy. The most common autoimmune and musculoskeletal irAEs reported in clinical trials are represented by arthralgia and arthritis. The incidence of arthralgia and/or inflammatory arthritis secondary to nivolumab therapy ranges from 5% to 16% and 5%, respectively. Although the immune mechanisms underlying irAEs have not been fully elucidated, studies suggest that Th17 and Tregs cells, increases in expression of immunologically-related genes, eosinophilia, microbiome among others and cytokines may be involved in the pathophysiology of immune-related complications in some diseases that resemble irAEs, such as colitis and rheumatic manifestations. Previous studies report Th-17, that drives interleukin-17 (IL-17) production, as a key mediator of many immune diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease and ICI-induced colitis, and IL-17 elevations have been observed in experimental colitis. Importantly, interleukin-6 (IL-6) promotes the differentiation of naïve CD4+ T cells into Th17 cells (17), and IL-6 inhibition may rebalance the altered Th17-Treg axis without inhibiting the Th1-CD8+ T-cell subsets that govern antitumor immunity. An imbalance of Th17/Treg may cause the onset and progression of immune-mediated side effects. Thus, a 3-fold increase of IL-17 and IL-6 by week 12, concomitant with the development of fulminant colitis has been reported in a patient who developed presumed ipilimumab-induced colitis. These findings raise the possibility of using
 IL-6 blockade as a strategy for treating colitis and arthritis induced by immune checkpoint blockade."

 Chronic delta hepatitis is a serious form of chronic liver disease caused by infection with the hepatitis D virus (HDV), a small RNA virus that requires farnesylation of its major structural protein (HDV antigen) for replication. Based on previous and ongoing clinical trials demonstrating effectiveness against HDV, we propose to treat 26 adult patients with chronic delta hepatitis using the combination of the farnesyltransferase inhibitor (FTI) lonafarnib (LNF), the protease inhibitor ritonavir (RTV) and peginterferon lambda-1a(lambda).
 In this phase 2a open label study, the safety and antiviral effects of triple therapy with
 LNF, RTV and lambda for a period of 6 months. After dosing, all patients will be monitored for 24 weeks off therapy. Nucleos(t)ide analogue therapy will be instituted/continued during this study to prevent the possibility of HBV reactivation/flare for the duration of participation in this clinical trial. Patients with quantifiable HDV RNA in serum will be enrolled. At each clinic visit, patients will be questioned about side effects, symptoms and quality of life, undergo focused physical examination, and have blood drawn for complete blood counts, HDV RNA, and routine liver tests (including ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, direct and total bilirubin, and albumin). At the end of the treatment, patients will be admitted to the clinical center and will undergo repeat liver biopsy and HVPG measurements, repeat physical examination, assessment of symptoms (using a symptom scale questionnaire), complete blood counts, routine liver tests, and hepatitis B and D viral markers. The primary therapeutic endpoint will be a decline of HDV RNA viral titer of 2 logs at the end of therapy. The primary safety endpoint will be the ability to tolerate the drugs at the prescribed dose for the full course of therapy. This clinical trial is designed as a phase 2a study assessing the antiviral activity, safety and tolerance of fixed doses of lonafarnib, ritonavir and peginterferon lambda."

 It is generally recognized that pain assessment and management in newborns and children is an unmet need. The Center for Disease Control found that in 2012, healthcare providers wrote 259 million prescriptions for opioid painkillers contributing to an epidemic of over prescription. At the same time, medical professionals still see large amounts of pain left untreated, particularly in pediatric populations. Children are often given minimal or no analgesia for procedures that are treated much more aggressively in adults. This issue stems from the lack of an effective method of assessing and monitoring patient analgesia. Recently attempts have been made to objectively quantify pain but as of now, no effective standard exists. This pilot study utilizes pupillary reflexes to characterize opioid analgesia in pediatrics with the purpose of synthesizing the data into algorithms that detect specific conditions and provide decision support.
 Pupillometry is a useful, non-invasive clinical and research tool that can provide valuable insights into the autonomic nervous system. Pupillary tests provide a convenient and simple method for evaluation of autonomic function4. In normal pupillary responsiveness, pupils should be equal in size, approximately 3-4mm in size under average light conditions, and reactive to light at >1mm of movement. The sympathetic nervous system is activated during periods of pain and stress and creates relaxation of the ciliary muscles resulting in pupillary dilation, or mydriasis. In accommodation, the parasympathetic axons that innervate the iris muscle produce constriction, or miosis. This reflex is known as the pupillary reflex dilation (PRD) and has been shown in previous studies to occur in both awake and anesthetized participants following a noxious stimulus5. This protocol will utilize these known reactions to track the response to specific neurostimulation in participants receiving opioids to determine the effect and effectiveness of the treatment.
 All mu opioid agonists cause miosis (constriction of the pupil) thus reducing the constriction amplitude and constriction velocity of the pupillary light reflex (PLR). This is the one opioid side effect to which tolerance does not occur. However, the pharmacologic impact is not consistent and will vary with different drugs in the class and duration of exposure. For example, morphine and Dilaudid (hydromorphone) each produce a neuro-excitatory metabolite that causes mydriasis or dilation of the pupil and also antagonizes the parent drug, producing the clinical appearance of tolerance, requiring more drug to achieve the same effect. With other drugs of this class such as fentanyl, which is commonly administered in
 ICUs, mydriasis may occur due to a phenomenon called opioid induced hyperalgesia (OIH) where there is an increased sensitivity to pain, often leading to an increased dose of drug.
 Increasing the dosing in this situation can potentially exacerbate the issue, having a method to monitor for OIH would provide decision support to physicians and allow them to recognize and properly reconcile this issue. Evaluation of PRD in response to a 5 Hz neuro-stimulus can differentiate between these drug-related issues and disease progression. This works because opioid receptors populate the C fibers, which are stimulated with a 5 Hz frequency6,7, allowing the investigators to determine dose response relationships as well as the optimized analgesic dose and precisely determine dosing with opioid rotation. This occurs empirically during standard of care based on a trial and error approach that risks under or overdosing patients and having tolerance, dependence and OIH occur.
 This pilot study is part of an ongoing effort to develop a method to objectively assess pain and its response to specific interventions. It specifically aims to develop profiles of the impact of a variety of opioids under a variety of conditions in a diverse patient population.
 It will allow researchers to understand better the specific impact of drugs in this class on the PLR and PRD. Data collected herein will help will evaluate the feasibility of using this approach to detect and monitor opioid analgesia and open new avenues for future research in this area. 1. Pain assessment and baseline testing 2. Standardized care where patient receives opioid dose per clinical team. 3. Testing pupillary reflexes at regular intervals and repeated pain assessments"

 Peritoneal carcinomatosis can be caused by primary peritoneal cancers and secondary peritoneal spread from stomach, colorectal, appendiceal, and/or gynecological cancers.
 Combined presentation of patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis make up about 67,000 new cancer diagnoses each year. Of these cases, about 25,000 patients are estimated to be candidates for cytoreductive surgery combined with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC); however, in 2009 only five percent of these patients received such treatment.
 Alternative therapies to cytoreductive surgery and HIPEC are few. They include surgical treatments with cytoreduction alone which are palliative in nature and inadequate to manage the disease, radiation which is limited in regard to tumors disseminated throughout abdominal cavity, systemic chemotherapy which has poor penetration into the peritoneum. Intraperitoneal chemotherapy via indwelling peritoneal catheter is limited due to port infections, toxicity, and unequal distribution in the abdominal cavity.
 For patients whose disease is limited to the peritoneal cavity, multi-modality treatment with cytoreductive surgery followed by intraoperative HIPEC can deliver chemotherapy directly to microscopic tumors at a higher concentration than is tolerated systemically. It causes disruption of cell membranes and induces apoptosis. Moreover when intraperitoneal chemotherapy is given at a higher temperature, it has a selective lethal effect on cancer cells secondary to improved tissue absorption. The typical side effects of systemic chemotherapy are also minimized with HIPEC.
 HIPEC is given intraoperatively in one treatment setting after all visible disease has been resected (i.e., cytoreductive surgery). The goal of cytoreductive surgery is to leave behind only microscopic disease and may require removal of adjacent organs. HIPEC is then delivered via tubings with temperature probes that are placed in the intraperitoneal cavity. The skin is then temporarily closed and the tubings are connected to a intraperitoneal hyperthermia and perfusion device that delivers sterile solution with chemotherapy into the abdomen. The device heats and circulates the chemotherapy for 90 minutes. After HIPEC is completed, abdomen is reopened and copiously irrigated. Surgical reconstruction with any removed organs (such as bowel) and fascial/skin closure are the final steps.
 Previous studies have shown conflicting results on survival benefit for patients with some of the aforementioned secondary peritoneal cancers who have undergone cytoreductive surgery and
 HIPEC. This study is an outcomes based study that seeks to look at the impact of HIPEC on overall survival and recurrence-free survival."

 Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder occurring most frequently in adolescent females, characterized by 1/ voluntary dietary restriction, leading to lower than normal body weight and, often, loss of considerable amount of weight and, thereby, malnutrition, 2/ intense fear of gaining weight, even when the individual is already underweight, starved or malnourished and 3/ disturbed body image perception, including extreme emphasis on the appearance.
 Anorexia nervosa is characterized by the potential severity of its prognosis. While complete remission occurs in about 50% of cases, up to 20% of patients will develop a chronic relapsing form that leads to social disintegration. Moreover, anorexia nervosa has the highest mortality rate among psychiatric diseases with a risk of death of up to 10% (including suicide and clinical complications of severe malnutrition). If approximatively 30% of deaths in anorexia nervosa are attributed to cardiac complications, the nature and the frequency of such complications remain insufficiently described, and their screening at a preclinical stage is still poorly codified. Echocardiography findings are well documented and include reduced left ventricular mass, pericardial effusion (in 22 to 35% of cases), or mitral valve prolapse (in up to 35% of cases); in addition, systolic function, evaluated by the ejection fraction appears to be preserved whereas a global diastolic dysfunction, estimated with trans-mitral flow and global longitudinal strain, is reported. While the interest of cardiac echography has been well established, only one study used MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) as a means of cardiac evaluation in anorexia nervosa: interestingly, this study found local myocardial fibrosis in nearly 25% of patients with anorexia nervosa, which could potentially contribute to cardiac rhythm disorders. That said, no study has yet used
 T1-Mapping MRI to evaluate if diffuse myocardial fibrosis is prevalent in this population group.
 The investigators aim to conduct a transversal, observational, monocentric study whereby malnourished patients with anorexia nervosa (n = 38) and age- and sex- matched, normal weight, healthy volunteers (n = 38) will undergo a gadolinium-enhanced cardiac MRI. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate and compare the frequency of cardiac fibrosis in those populations using cardiac MRI. Other morphological and functional cardiac MRI parameters will be described and compared as secondary objectives: local myocardial fibrosis using enhanced MRI; myocardial and left ventricular mass; myocardial triglyceride quantification using Proton spectroscopy; cardiac high-energy metabolism using Phosphore-31 spectroscopy. Moreover, non-cardiac parameters evaluated by MRI such as adipose tissue distribution (visceral fat, liver fat, bone marrow fat) in anorexia nervosa patients compared with controls.
 In addition, patients with anorexia nervosa, a clinical, morphological and biological evaluation, including anthropometric parameters, biphotonic absorptiometry, resting electrocardiogram, cardiac echography and classical biological markers of malnutrition, will be done. Multivariate analysis will then be used to identify possible correlating factors between cardiac MRI findings and clinical, morphological and biological parameters in malnourished patients with anorexia nervosa, so as to shed light on possible new risk stratification models or predictive tools for cardiac complications that could be later evaluated by appropriate studies."

 Classic BCR-ABL negative chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) are stem cell disorders characterized by abnormal myeloid proliferation and increased blood cell counts and comprise polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF).
 Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) are common malignancies in elderly individuals as the combined annual incidence rates of classical MPNs were reported to be 0.84, 1.03, and 0.47 per 100,000 respectively for PV, ET, and PMF but with a wide variation in prevalence rates reported in different studies. The 5-year relative survival rates are 84.8, 89.9, and 39% for
 PV, ET and PMF patients, respectively.
 Thromboembolic complications represent a major cause of morbidity and mortality in MPN, particularly in PV and ET. The mechanisms underlying increased thrombotic risk in chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) are incompletely understood.
 Several pathophysiological mechanisms help explain the increased likelihood of thrombosis in these patients. Factors, such as leukocyte and platelet activation leading to the formation of leukocyte-platelet aggregates, activation of the coagulation cascade by microparticles, high levels of inflammatory cytokines, and endothelial dysfunction have a crucial role in thrombosis in MPN patients.
 Accurate prediction of the thrombotic risk still represents a challenge and adequate predictive biomarkers are not available. The mechanisms underlying thrombosis involve a complex interplay among blood cells, the endothelium and the coagulation system. Both increased blood counts and cellular activation, which is due to hyperactivation of intracellular signaling pathways and enhanced interaction between blood cells, are implicated in the thrombotic predisposition.
 The JAK2V617F mutation is a diagnostic marker for MPN and it also plays an important role in patient treatment since inhibition of JAK2-associated proliferative pathways has the potential to inhibit cell proliferation in MPNs. This mutation is present in 95% of PV patients and 50% of ET or PMF patients. Thrombosis and hemostasis are major complications that affect the life expectancy of patients with MPN.
 Current guidelines recommend testing for JAK2 mutations in any patient suspected to have an
 MPN. JAK2 mutation leads to distinct changes in hematopoietic cells that increase the likelihood of thrombus formation.
 The risk of thrombosis, in both PV and ET, exceeds 20% and a substantial proportion of patients experience vasomotor disturbances (e.g. headaches, lightheadedness, acral paresthesias, erythromelalgia, atypical chest pain, ocular disturbances, tinnitus) and in case of PV, pruritus.
 Mean platelet volume (MPV) is largely considered as a useful indirect marker of platelet activation. Larger platelets are metabolically and enzymatically more active, and have a greater prothrombotic potential. Elevated MPV is associated with other markers of platelet activity, including increased platelet aggregation, increased thromboxane synthesis and beta-thromboglobulin release, and increased expression of adhesion molecules.
 High sensitivity CRP is an inflammatory marker might be useful to reflect a condition of chronic inflammation which is associated with the disease severity .
 In addition, Elevated CRP and elevated LDH are risk factors for survival in MPN patients.
 Elevated γ-Glutamyl (γ-GT) transferase is an independent risk factor for Splanchnic venous thrombosis (SVT) presence in MPN.
 About 30% of vascular events in Ph-negative MPN patients are VTE, which generally present as lower limb deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary artery embolism. However, in Ph-negative MPN,
 VTE characteristically occurs in uncommon locations such as splanchnic veins, including hepatic veins (presenting Budd-Chiari syndrome), portal and mesenteric veins, or, less frequently, cerebral veins or sinuses. In patients with MPN, the prevalence of CVT is 3-7% of cases.
 Myeloproliferative neoplasms are known to be pro-thrombotic diseases (arterial and venous).
 For both of ET and PV, thromboses occur more frequently in arterial sites (between 64 and 75% for PV, and between 72 and 91% for ET).
 JAK2 mutation can affect cardiac arteries and veins in ET and PV, which results in thrombosis, ischemia and other cardiovascular events. JAK/STAT signaling pathway plays an important role in heart diseases. High incidence of atrial arrhythmias among patients with ET or PV. The patients were older, cumulating more cardiovascular risk factors inducing more thrombotic events mainly in arteries, and have a higher incidence of death.
 The importance of treatment compliance has now been clearly established in many pathological conditions as poor adherence has a negative impact on clinical evolution and non-adherence to cytoreductive therapy was associated with a significant reduction in the complete haematological remission rate but no significant association between thrombosis or death and non-adherence was found. This may be related to the fact that thrombosis is a more acute event, depending on the immediate hemostatic status at the time of thrombus constitution, whereas the phenotypic evolution of chronic haematological malignancies may be more the result of long term evolution of the clone, reflecting its exposure to therapeutic pressure.
 Patients with MPN should also avoid factors that are known to increase risk of VTE, including systemic hormone therapy such as oral contraceptive pills and smoking, and optimize cardiovascular risk factors, including control of blood pressure, diabetes, and cholesterol, in order to minimize thrombotic complications."

 Behavior problems are a common and concerning challenge among children with developmental delay (DD). Approximately 50% of children with DD have a comorbid mental disorder or serious behavior problems- a prevalence three times as high as that found in typically developing youths. Behavioral parent training (BPT) is the gold-standard intervention for treating child behavior problems in typically developing children and in children with DD. However, high levels of parental stress are associated with reduced or no response to BPT for children with
 DD. Consequently, parental stress may attenuate the efficacy of the gold-standard, empirically supported treatment for behavior problems among children with DD. As such, parental stress is a critical point of intervention for improving both parent and child outcomes in families of children with DD. The purpose of this study is to quantify the therapeutic benefit of adding a parent stress-reduction intervention prior to delivering BPT in order to more effectively reduce child behavior problems, and to investigate the mechanisms through which intervention outcomes occur."

 This is a study intended to validate a new set of guidelines for a device that uses light to measure the amount of oxygen in the muscles of injured and non-injured legs and forearms in specific situations. The name of this technology is NIRS (near-infrared spectroscopy). We have shown NIRS can be helpful in diagnosing ACS. We think two of the primary advantages of this device are that it is noninvasive (not painful) and it collects data continuously, so that if the disease develops, it can be detected early and treated appropriately. We have studied the capabilities of NIRS for many years. The last step in the process of proving NIRS and its use in ACS will be to test our recommendations and guidelines. The goal of this study is to test and prove our clinical guidelines we developed through previous work. This is an interventional study, which means the data we collect will be used to manage the patient and their care."

 A total of 40 patients from the Vinalopó-Salud Hospital of Elche (Spain) who underwent bariatric surgery between 2010-2013, were recruited. Male and female participants were eligible if they complied with the following inclusion criteria: a) absence of cardiovascular disease; b) they had not suffered any type of cancer in the 5-year period before surgery; c) absence of functional limitations that prevented them from performing the exercise program.
 Before starting the study, an initial interview was conducted with the patients to verify that they complied with the inclusion criteria. In this interview, all aspects of the program were carefully explained. At the start of the study, all patients who had agreed to participate signed an informed consent. This study was conformed to the Declaration of
 Helsinki and approved by the Ethics Committees of the University. Two patients declined to participate in the study after the initial interview. Finally, 38 patients started the study and 18 finished it.
 One month after surgery, participant's body composition, anthropometric measures and resting blood pressure were assessed. These assessments were performed periodically every six months until month 19 after surgery. At an average of 37.10 ± 4.35 months of follow-up after surgery, they were distributed into two groups, an experimental group (EG; n=10), and a control group (CG; n=8). The EG group performed a monitored exercise program, while only the evaluations were performed in the CG. At this point, measurements of cardiorespiratory fitness and biochemical parameters were added to the previous assessments (anthropometric measures and blood pressure) for the EG. An assessment was performed coinciding with the start of the exercise program (which lasted 20 weeks), and a final assessment was also performed at the end of the program. Finally, the EG was evaluated 2 months after the end of the exercise program.
 Body composition, waist and hip circumference, blood pressure and biochemical parameters were evaluated between 8:00 ante meridien (AM) and 9:00 AM. Cardiorespiratory fitness was evaluated between 4:00 post meridien (PM) and 8:00 PM. Measurements were performed in a climatically controlled laboratory, located at 80 m above sea level, in which the relative air humidity was maintained between 45-60% and the temperature between 22-24º.
 Body composition, anthropometric measures and cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF) After at least 10 hours of fasting, body composition, biochemical parameters and blood pressure were measured. Alcohol consumption was restricted for at least 8 hours before the test, while PA was forbidden in the 48 hours prior to the test. Participants performed the assessment with an empty bladder. Bioimpedance analysis (Tanita, TBF 300A, Tokyo, Japan) was used to establish body weight and body composition. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated according to the formula: total weight in kilograms divided by squared height in meters (kg·m-2). The
 International Society for the Advancement of Kinanthropometry (ISAK) protocol was used to assess height and waist and hip circumference. Blood pressure was measured using a digital sphygmomanometer (Microlife WatchBP Home, Heerbrugg, Switzerland), according to established recommendations. Capillary blood samples were taken to analyse blood glucose and Total
 Cholesterol (TC) using a portable multi-analyser (Accutrend GCT, Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim,
 Germany).
 Cardiorespiratory fitness The peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak) was determined on a cycle ergometer (Technogym Bike Med, Technogym, Gambettola, Italy), using an Oxycon Pro gas analysis system (Jaeger, Friedberg, Germany) by adapted protocol from Achten. The protocol had two phases: a) a first phase in which the participants performed a 4-minute warm-up at 40 watts (W), followed by increases of 20 W every 3 minutes, maintaining a cadence of 60 rotations per minute (RPM) during the whole phase; and, b) a second phase that started when the respiratory exchange ratio reached 1.0, and which was aimed to determine the VO2peak.
 This phase consisted of increments of 20 W every minute, maintaining a cadence between 70-80
 RPM, until volitional fatigue. The VO2peak was calculated as the average of the highest 30 seconds of VO2. The VO2peak was expressed in absolute values (VO2peak ABS) and normalized to total body weight (VO2peak/BW) and fat-free mass (VO2peak/FFM).
 Cardiovascular risk (CVR) The SCORE risk charts of the European Society of Cardiology were used to calculate CVR. The formula to calculate CVR estimates the 10-year coronary risk using
 TC, systolic blood pressure, gender, age, and smoking status. In addition, CVR was also calculated using waist to hip ratio, and waist to height ratio.
 Health-related quality of life The health-related quality of life was measured by the Short
 Form Health Survey 36 (SF-36), in its version adapted to the Spanish context. This questionnaire measures physical and mental health through 8 scales, the scores of which are transformed to values between 0-100 points, with the highest scores meaning a better function. These 8 scales are grouped into two summary components, the physical summary component, and the mental summary component, which were calculated according to the reference values of the Spanish population, with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10.
 The exercise program lasted 20 weeks, which were distributed in five 4-week blocks. The first
 -block included two weekly sessions, in which the endurance training (ET) and the resistance training (RT) for 5 muscle groups (hamstrings, pectorals, quadriceps, latissimus dorsi, and gastrocnemius) was combined in the same session. In the second block participants trained 3 days a week, in two of them a high-intensity interval training (HIIT) was performed, followed by RT (biceps and triceps were added to the previous 5 major muscle groups trained), while in the third session only the ET was performed. Between the third and fifth block participants trained 4 days a week. In two sessions, a HIIT was performed, followed by RT, focusing on different muscle groups in each session: a) session 1: pectorals, quadriceps, biceps, and hamstrings; b) session 2: dorsal, triceps, gastrocnemius and deltoids. In the other two sessions, ET was performed. In all the blocks, 2 days a week of flexibility training were carried out.
 The ET (performed on a cycle-ergometer, elliptical and treadmill) was monitored using a heart rate (HR) monitor (FT40, Polar, Finland). The RT was performed using resistance machines, and training intensity was determined by percentages of 1 maximum repetition which was estimated using the Brzycki formula.
 The HIIT consisted of a five-minute warm up, increasing the intensity from 40% of VO2peak to 60% VO2peak. After this, 20 minutes with bouts of 30 seconds at high intensity (60-95%
 VO2peak) and 30 seconds of active recovery (40% VO2peak), for a total of 10 minutes of training at high intensity were performed. Finally, 3 minutes of cool-down at 40% VO2peak were performed."

 Introduction
 Methadone maintenance therapy (MMT) is one of the modalities to prevent HIV transmission among injected drug users, particularly in opioid-dependent users. However, methadone-associated cardiotoxicity is one of the fatal adverse events that limit the widespread usage in certain groups of opioid-dependent patients.
 Study hypotheses / aims
 The investigators hypothesized that subjects with minor alleles of those 4 SNPs would have longer QTc intervals than those with major alleles, adjusting for the effects of other confounding factors such as age and gender of the subjects, plasma methadone trough levels, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia. The investigators also aimed to provide a model that will reliably predict the magnitude QTc based on the SNPs data and other covariates mentioned above. This will greatly assist in identifying methadone recipients who are at risk of developing prolonged QTc or the more fatal torsade de pointes.
 Study Design and Sample Size Calculation
 This is a cross-sectional study aimed to investigate the association between 4 KCNH2 SNPs (1539C>T, in exon 6 of KCNH2 gene; 1956T>C, in exon 8 of KCNH2 gene), 2350C>T (in exon 9 of
 KCNH2 gene), 2690A>C (Exon 11 of KCNH2 gene)) and prolongation of QTc interval in opioid-dependent Kelantanese Malays who are the recipients of Methadone Maintenance Therapy .
 The sample size was calculated using single-proportion formula and the information required was based on a similar prior study conducted among Singaporean Malay. It was concluded that the sample size required is 105 patients. Since eligible patients were lacking, the convenience (non-probability) sampling method was used.
 During the initial visit, relevant clinico-demographic details such as age, gender, history of drug addiction and psychiatric illnesses, drug dependency patterns, other drug usage and treatment-related issues for each patient were gathered. Subsequently a validated Malay version of Subjective Opioid Withdrawal Scale (SOWS) questionnaire was administered to assess any opioid withdrawal symptoms experienced by study participants.
 Five (5) mls of blood was then withdrawn for each subject for the ascertainment of relevant biochemical profile (serum potassium, magnesium, calcium), plasma methadone trough levels, and KCNH2 SNPs genotyping. Drug screening for substances such as MDMA, benzodiazepines methamphetamine, cannabis, marijuana were also carried out using urine dipstick test at urine collection point. The colour and temperature of the urine were also recorded.
 QT measurement was obtained using calibrated Welch Allyn CP 50™ ECG (Electrocardiograph) (Welch Allyn Australia Pty Ltd., New South Wales, Australia) machine, printed at a paper speed of 25mm/s and voltage of 10mm/mV. QTc measurement was then manually calculated using
 Fredericia's formula to correct for heart rate (R-R interval). All trained personnel who were responsible for obtaining QTc measurement from each patient were blinded to other information on serum biochemical profiles and methadone trough levels.
 KCNH2 Genotyping
 The DNA was extracted according to procedures modified from Bethesda Research Laboratories based on the revisions made to the Brinboam and Doly method. The quantity and quality of the extracted DNA were determined using NanoDrop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer (NanoDrop
 Technologies, Inc. Wilmington, USA) with measurements done at 260 and 280 nm. The integrity of the extracted DNA was determined using 2% agarose gel electrophoresis performed at 70
 Volts for 90 minutes.
 The DNA in all samples were amplified for all 4KCNH2 SNPs were performed using 2-step nested allele-specific multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The primers (both forward and reverse) were designed according to the published sequence for KCNH2 (NC_000007.13). To improve primer specificity, mismatch at its 3´ ends that were specific to either the variant sequence or wild-type DNA sequence at the specified locus was made to the primers. Besides, the primers were also designed and manipulated to differentiate between the different single nucleotide changes/alleles during PCR amplification. To verify primers specificity, the BLAST program at NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ blast) was used.
 In the first multiplex PCR, exon 6,8,9 and 11 were amplified under the following condition: pre-denaturation at 95°C for 1 minute followed by 25-cycle of denaturation at 95°C for 15 seconds, annealing for 65°C for 15 seconds, and extension at 72°C for 10 seconds. Upon full 25-cycle completion, final extension phase lasted for 72°C for 7 minutes. The PCR products (amplicons) were then resolved using 2% agarose gel electrophoresis at 130 Volts for 90 minutes.
 The PCR products of the first multiplex PCR were then used as templates for second PCR which targeted the 4 respective SNPs region for amplification. This was performed under the following condition:pre-denaturation at 95°C for 1 minute followed by 25-cycle of denaturation at 95°C for 15 seconds, annealing for 69°C for 30 seconds, and extension at 72°C for 4 seconds. Upon full 25-cycle completion, final extension phase lasted for 72°C for 7 minutes. The PCR products (amplicons) were then resolved using 2% agarose gel electrophoresis at 130 Volts for 90 minutes.
 The first products of the amplified regions in the Exons 6, 8, 9, and Exon11 were subsequently submitted for direct DNA sequencing. QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, USA) was used for purification of the PCR products. DNA sequencing was carried out by applying 3130XL genetic analyzer DNA sequencer (ABI, USA). The results were compared with the published sequences for KCNH2 in the NCBI, accession number (NC_000007.13)
 Statistical Analysis
 The select equally likely or more extreme samples (SELOME) version of the Fisher's exact test was employed to examine whether the distribution of the SNP alleles and genotype follow the
 Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) assumption. Those SNPs that significantly deviated from the
 HWE assumption were dropped from further analysis.
 To examine the associations between the 4SNPs and QTc interval (measured as continuous variable) and build a statistical model that can reliably predict QTc intervals, simple and multiple linear regression methods were used. Age and gender of the patients, plasma methadone trough levels, serum potassium, calcium and magnesium were treated as confounding factors whose effects on QTc were adjusted for."

 Each patient will be informed of the objectives and the total duration of the study as well as the benefits and risks to participate. After signature of consent form, Genotyping
 Resistance Test (GRT) and pre-inclusion samples will be done for all patients with HIV RNA > 1000 copies/mL after 3 months of boosted adherence counselling (BAC). After receiving results of the GRT and the pre-inclusion sample, the technical working group (TWG) of HIV national program will decide to switch the patient to third-line regimen or to continue second-line regimen with new BAC.
 PI-based second-line regimen will be continue if 1/ GRT shows sensitivity to ATV 2/ GRT shows sensitivity to at least one of the 3 NRTI recommended in Cambodia (AZT, ABC and TDF). In that case, adherence counselling will be boosted according to the new national guidance and the patient will not be enrolled in the study.

 Type I diabetes affects the body's ability to respond to low blood sugar (hypoglycemia).
 Repeated episodes of hypoglycemia may affect an individual's autonomic system, and leads to hypoglycemia associated autonomic failure (HAAF) in 2/3 of individuals. This study is looking at healthy, non-diabetic individuals who are susceptible to developing HAAF and their response to either naloxone nasal spray alone or in combination with diazoxide in improving their body's ability to respond to episodes of low blood sugar, and in preventing the development of HAAF.
 The body's response to episodes of hypoglycemia is measured using a procedure called a hypoglycemic clamp; each phase of this study involves three clamp procedures over a period of 2 days. During the clamp procedures, glucose (a sugar) and insulin (a hormone produced in the pancreas that regulates the amount of glucose in the blood) are infused with an intravenous catheter, and blood samples are collected periodically throughout the procedure to measure blood sugar levels and the levels of several hormones, including epinephrine, that are found in the body and are related to glucose metabolism. The rates of endogenous glucose production (a measure of the body's production of sugar) will be measured. Additionally, the level of awareness of hypoglycemia symptoms will be monitored using a standardized questionnaire.
 Both hypoglycemia and stress activate the body's opioid system. Recently published data has shown that blocking opioid receptors with naloxone may increase the body's ability to respond to hypoglycemia.The body's response to hypoglycemia affects many systems, and acting on several of these systems may help the body to respond more effectively to episodes of low blood sugar, and to prevent the development of HAAF. Studies have shown that potassium channels in the hypothalamus, a part of the brain, have an important role in detecting hypoglycemia. Diazoxide activates potassium channels in the cells of the brain that respond to changes in sugar (glucose) that occur in the body, and may also reduce the development of hypoglycemia associated autonomic failure. Additionally, certain glucose-responsive cells in the brain have opioid receptors that are combined with potassium channels which may respond to both diazoxide and naloxone which may work together to more effectively increase the body's ability to respond to episodes of low blood sugar and prevent HAAF."

 Lung cancer is a malignant tumor with the highest morbidity and mortality in China and all over the world, in which non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for more than 85% of all categories [1-2]. Although the precision medicine has greatly improved the survival time of patients with NSCLC, most patients still have recurrence and metastasis after a period of time [3]. The nature of tumorigenesis, development and metastasis is a series of biochemical processes, such as abnormal gene expression and metabolism, dysfunction and structural change. Early prediction of tumor metastasis and accurate and timely clinical intervention will not only help clinicians to formulate treatment plans, but also reduce unnecessary side effects and medical expenses with ineffective treatment. 18F-FDG-PET scans can reflect metabolic changes at cellular and molecular level, and the metabolic information are transmitted earlier than anatomical changes. Detection of 18F-FDG uptake, analysis of tumor metabolism, tissue blood flow perfusion, receptor, and so on, can provide a theoretical basis for monitoring the therapeutic efficacy of lung cancer by PET [4].
 As a new imaging technique, 18F-FDG PET/CT plays a more and more important role in the diagnosis of tumor. 18F-FDG PET/CT reflects the process of glucose metabolism in tumor tissue. The diagnosis of benign and malignant tumors is based on the difference of glucose metabolism activity between tumor cells and normal tissue cells. 18F-FDG is the isomer of glucose, which participates in the process of glucose metabolism. Because it cannot produce hexose diphosphate because of its deoxidation, it cannot participate in the next metabolism, and it is retained in cells. Due to the high expression of glucose transport mRNA,the level of Glut-1 and Glut-3 increased, the expression of hexokinase increased, and the level of glucose-6-phosphatase decreased, which resulted in an increase of 18F-FDG uptake in tumor cells [5]. Molecular imaging using 18F-FDG PET / CT can provide metabolic information, which can make benign and malignant tissues differentiate better, and reveal the functional abnormalities before structural damage [6]. However, the current PET/CT scans reported in the relevant literature are based on conventional static scans, i.e. the image data is based on a static take-up image of the tracer in tissue obtained at a fixed time point after the injection of 18F-FDG. To improve, the investigators propose to use dynamic data scanning, which captures the dynamic data of whole body tissues collected from the moment of injecting 18F-FDG to an hour. Dynamic scans can provide information on the dynamic changes in tracer metabolism and distribution in tissues over time, so they provide a richer metabolic and distributional pattern of tumor foci and metastases than static scans. Therefore, the aim of this study is to make up for this gap by performing a dynamic scan of 18F-FDG PET/CT on newly diagnosed patients with non-small cell lung cancer. The lesions and/or metastases are performed for biopsy. Pathological and genomic studies are performed. The differences between tumor images and tissues are compared at the same time. 18F-FDG PET/CT dynamic imaging is explored in non-small cell lung cancer metastases for the diagnostic value."

 Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) and diabetic macular edema (DME) frequently occur together in patients with diabetic retinopathy In the landmark study Protocol S, about 30% of
 PDR subjects had DME at baseline and 53% of subjects receiving panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) underwent treatment for DME during the 2-year study interval. Vitreous hemorrhaging is one of the most common indications for pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) in patients with PDR. PDR patients undergoing PPV for the treatment of vitreous hemorrhaging often have coexisting DME, although it is often difficult to identify preoperatively because of the media opacification from the vitreous hemorrhage. Following successful PPV and vitreous hemorrhage resolution,
 PDR patients may then require prolonged DME treatment with repetitive intravitreal injections and/or focal lasers.
 PPV with internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling has been reported to reduce retinal edema and improve visual acuity in patients with DME. Although numerous studies report favorable outcomes in patients undergoing PPV with ILM peeling for the surgical indication of DME, there are presently not any studies evaluating ILM peeling in PDR patients undergoing PPV for the primary indication of vitreous hemorrhaging. Performing ILM peeling in conjunction with the usual techniques for addressing a vitreous hemorrhage (i.e. endolaser PRP, endodiathermy, etc.) during PPV may offer the benefits of better postoperative visual acuity and/or fewer postoperative treatments required to manage DME. In this randomized controlled trial, the authors evaluate the merits of ILM peeling in PDR patients undergoing PPV for the primary indication of vitreous hemorrhaging."

 Background:
 Few population-based studies have recently investigated the epidemiology of childhood respiratory symptoms in Switzerland.
 Objectives:
 The Luftibus in the school study was setup to assess the respiratory health of schoolchildren from the canton of Zurich and to investigate relationships between respiratory symptoms, lung function and air pollution.
 Methods:
 Recruitment and participation:
 All schools in the canton of Zürich were invited to participate in the LUIS study. Those schools interested in participating were approached. The eligible study population were children aged 6 to 16 years with parental consent from the schools that agreed to participate. Prior to each school visit, parents received a letter with information about the project, an informed consent form and a questionnaire. During the school visit, trained field workers performed lung function tests in children at the school, interviewed the children using a short questionnaire and collected the parental questionnaires. A subsample of the schools was visited again one year after the first visit in order to collect follow-up information, using the same procedure and gathering the same measurements.
 Information collected:
 - Parental questionnaire: Frequency, duration, severity, triggers of upper and lower respiratory symptoms, previous doctor diagnosis of asthma, use of medication, health behaviors, environmental factors, household characteristics and family history.
 - Children's questionnaire: Respiratory symptoms, asthma diagnosis, medication and smoking.
 - Anthropometric data: Height and weight were measured by fieldworkers in the schools in a standardized way.
 - Complementary tests: Spirometry, fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) and double tracer gas single-breath washout (SBW) were performed in the school by trained fieldworkers according to ATS criteria.
 - Air pollution measurements: Air pollution detectors placed on the roof of the bus measured nitrogen dioxide (NO2), inhalable particles of 10 micrometers or less in diameter (PM10) and ozone concentration at the school site.
 Study database:
 The study questionnaire database was created using Epidata, which allows data entry and data extraction in CVS format.

 In the setting of altitude-induced hypoxia, cognitive capacity degrades and can compromise both individual and team performance. This degradation is linked to falling brain energy (ATP) levels and an increased reliance on anaerobic energy production from glucose. Ketone bodies are the evolutionary alternative substrate to glucose for brain metabolic requirements; previous studies have shown that the presence of elevated ketone bodies (ketosis) maintains brain ATP levels and reduce cerebral anaerobic glycolysis during hypoxia.
 Ketosis can be achieved when fasting or following a ketogenic diet; however, these approaches are impractical. Exogenous ketone ester supplementation allows for rapid (< 30 mins) and significant elevation of blood ketone levels without the need to maintain a diet or fast.
 HVMN, in collaboration with researchers at IHMC, proposes a study to investigate the effects of consuming an FDA-approved ketone ester 'food' on cognitive performance in the setting of hypoxia. For the proposed 4-arm within-subject study, participants will complete a cognitive performance test battery under the conditions of normoxia and then hypoxia following consumption of a ketone ester drink or a placebo drink (N.B for each study drink cognitive performance in both hypoxia and normoxia will be assessed in ONE visit):
 VISIT A:
 Arm1: Normoxia + Placebo Arm 2: Hypoxia + Placebo
 VISIT B:
 Arm 3: Normoxia + Ketone ester Arm 4: Hypoxia + Ketone ester
 The investigators hypothesize that ketone ester supplementation will attenuate hypoxia-induced deterioration of operator cognitive performance."

 Only patients with scheduled operations were screened for eligibility in this study.
 Screening period for each patient lasted from 1 to 14 days. All patients eligible as per protocol criteria were randomized in 1:1 ratio to receive investigational or reference drug.
 Randomisation was carried out in admission to the operating room - Day1.
 For the induction of anesthesia, first there was administration of the trial drug / reference drug, then - administration of a narcotic analgesic (fentanyl at a dose of 2 mg/kg), after which after loss of consciousness, muscle relaxant was used (rocuronium bromide at a dose of 0.6-0.9 mg/kg). Tracheal intubation was performed after achieving the necessary relaxation of the muscles.
 Maintenance of anesthesia during surgery was done using the trial drug / reference drug, muscle relaxant (rocuronium bromide - if necessary, during the anesthesia maintenance, the dose was selected individually) and narcotic analgetic (fentanyl, if necessary, during the anesthesia maintenance, the dose was selected individually). To control patient's condition before, during and after surgery, the significant vital parameters were monitored (level of blood pressure and heart rate, respiratory rate, body temperature, saturation, intraoperative
 ECG, bispectral index (BIS)).
 After the operation patients were transferred to the postoperation room where the assessment of the operation memory, and possible presence of postoperative delirium was performed as well as on Day 2. Further treatment and determination of compliance of patient's condition with the criteria for discharge from the hospital was carried out in accordance with current practice of the center.
 In 7 (± 2) days after the end of trial drugs administration, patient's condition monitoring and safety evaluation were carried out through telephone contact with the patient, during which data on adverse events and concomitant therapy were collected. Scheduled trial duration for each patient was a maximum of 24 days.
 Therapy was considered ineffective, if other sedatives were required for induction (loss of consciousness was not registered after study drugs dose adjustment) and/or maintenance of the required level of sedation during anesthesia (in case of signs of awakening appeared and remained after study drugs dose adjustment).
 Therapy efficacy evaluation was based on primary and secondary efficacy criteria. Effect of general anesthetic, a combined evaluation criterion consisted of the following criteria. The trial drug/reference drug was regarded effective in patients who had not had any of the below criteria and ineffective in patients who had at least one of the below criteria: 1. Intraoperative awakening / preservation of memories of operations; 2. The need for additional sedation."

 Reducing pain and improving function is of great importance in the immediate period after surgery. Many orthopaedic procedures result in fluid build-up around the surgical site which results in pain and decreased healing. Glucocorticoids are drugs that block the inflammatory process which can decrease this pain and fluid build-up. Furthermore, glucocorticoids are safe if given in low doses and for a short period of time. To help address this gap, the study intend to give patients glucocorticoids after various upper extremity orthopedic procedures; total hip arthroplasty for osteoarthritis of the hip or total knee arthroplasty for osteoarthritis of the knee, assessing their pain and range of motion post-operatively.
 The study hypothesize that glucocorticoids will result in less inflammation around the surgical site, leading to pain relief, greater healing ability, and improvements in range of motion of the injured joint.
 The study aims to enroll 1000 subjects that are assigned randomly to one of two treatment arms: (1) single intraoperative dose of 10 mg intravenous dexamethasone (control group), IV dexamethasone is standard of care) or (2) single intraoperative dose of 10 mg intravenous dexamethasone followed with a 6-day oral methylprednisolone taper course (active group).

 Primary oral infection with the herpes simplex virus (HSV) typically occurs at a young age, is asymptomatic, and is not associated with significant morbidity. After primary oral infection, HSV may persist in a latent state in the trigeminal ganglion and later reactivate as the more common herpes labialis, or cold sores. Common triggers for reactivation are well known and include ultraviolet light, trauma, fatigue, stress, fever, inflammation, and menstruation. These lesions affect up to 45 percent of the U.S. population. They classically manifest as a well-localized cluster of small vesicles along the vermilion border of the lip or adjacent skin. The vesicles subsequently rupture, ulcerate, and crust within 24 to 48 hours. Spontaneous healing occurs over seven to 10 days. In immunocompetent patients, herpes labialis usually is mild and self-limited. However, pain, swelling, and cosmetic concerns may prompt physician consultation. Orally administered antiviral agents, such as acyclovir (Zovirax) or valacyclovir (Valtrex), have a modest clinical benefit if initiated during the prodrome. Topical treatment with 1% penciclovir cream (Denavir) may reduce healing time and pain slightly, even if initiated after the prodrome. However, reduction in healing time with systemic or topical agents is modest. Squaric acid dibutyl ester (SADBE) is a topical immunotherapeutic agent used in the treatment of verruca vulgaris and alopecia areata. During a recent FDA Compounding Advisory Committee Meeting, it was recommended that squaric acid dibutylester be included on the list of bulk drug substances allowed for use in compounding under section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. And SADBE has now been so listed under section 503A. A study completed by Lee et al of 29 patients with recalcitrant warts demonstrated complete clearance in 69% of patients with application every 2-4 weeks.
 Silverberg et al showed a complete clearance in 58% of patients (n=61) when SADBE was applied 3 times weekly. SADBE has also been used with some success in the treatment of alopecia areata. In a review of the literature, Rokhsar et al noted a 50% to 60% success rate of SADBE in use for hair re-growth in this population. SADBE has been reported to cause eczema, lymphadenopathy, blistering, allergic contact dermatitis, skin hypopigmentation, a burning sensation after application, and systemic reactions including fever and arthralgias. A study completed by Oglio et al of eight patients treated with SADBE for warts noted only mild and well tolerated side effects of erythema, desquamation, cutaneous edema, pruritus, burning, and pain. SADBE induces a delayed-type hypersensitivity response which in warts, is believed to induce the killing of virally infected cells by cytotoxic lymphocytes. This influx of lymphocytes into lesional Page 4 of 14 tissue may also enhance the recognition and processing of viral antigens, leading to clonal expansion of effector cells. It is hoped that SADBE will offer subjects a safe and effective therapeutic option to decrease the frequency and severity of future herpes labialis outbreaks through these mechanisms. A placebo-controlled clinical study completed at Massachusetts General Hospital showed that squaric acid prevented recurrence of herpetic lesions. The effect of SADBE of delaying new herpes labialis outbreaks was highly significant (p<0.01) as compared to placebo."

 According to Mental Health America, 1 in 5 adults have a mental health condition. Mental health is associated with higher incidence of chronic diseases, lower use of medical care, and one of five most costly conditions in the US in 2006 according to the American
 Psychological Association. The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) has called for residents to develop an understanding of social-behavioral sciences as a basis for patient care. ACGME advises that the curriculum is extended to physical aspects of patient care as well as the emotional, social and behavioral aspects. The Society of Teachers of Family Medicine (STFM) has also suggested the importance of the psychosocial realm.
 According to both the ACGME and STFM, being able to glean the necessary information is an integral part of being a family doctor.
 The need for healthcare providers, medical students, and residents to possess basic interviewing, counseling and agenda setting skills to ascertain the pertinent contextual (e.g., familial, social, cultural, spiritual, etc.), health behavior, and health risk factors of patients' lives, is vital to close the gap on behavioral health and chronic diseases. In order to evaluate learners' interviewing skills, the Contextual Interview Observation Form (CIOF) an observation tool was developed using Robinson, Gould, and Strosahl's (2010) interview format. The CIOF can be used to teach a contextual interview procedure that is organized in a logical manner with a practical format. This contextual interview provides a no-cost format for the learner to capture the context of patients' behaviorally influenced health concerns and is applicable during the 4-year curriculum as well as during the clerkship years.
 Many Americans lack access to health care, with an even greater shortage of access to mental health providers, especially in rural and underserved areas. Improving access to behavioral health providers and recognition of mental illness via telemedicine, could lead to improved patient outcomes and cost. However, in the pedagogical course of medical education, the investigators do not provide a robust platform for teaching telemedicine. Implementing the
 CIOF in a telesimulation format will allow for healthcare providers, behavior health providers, medical students, and residents to practice and experience providing basic interviewing and counseling via telemedicine. According to McCoy et al, telesimulation is a process by which telecommunication and simulation resources are utilized to provide education, training, and/or assessment to learners at an off-site location. Off-site location refers to a distant site that would preclude the education, training, and/or assessment without the use of telecommunication resources.
 Pacific Northwest University of Health Sciences educates and trains healthcare professionals emphasizing service among rural and medically underserved communities throughout the
 Northwest. Specifically, the investigators cover rural and underserved areas in Alaska,
 Washington, Oregon, Montana, and Idaho. PNWU's envisioned Institute for Interprofessional
 Practice & Education (IIPE) focuses on cultivating healthcare teams from a variety of professional backgrounds to enhance person-centered health care. One goal of PNWU's strategic plan is to expand graduate level educational opportunities. In response to that goal, the
 Yakima Valley Interprofessional Practice and Education Collaborative (YVIPEC) was established in the fall of 2014 to promote the highest quality health care in the region through a culture of inclusive and collaborative interprofessional education, practice, and scholarship. Interprofessional education (IPE) fosters a team-based approach to health care which is the approach used in rural health clinics and is reported to be critical to success in working in medically underserved areas. These collaborations include:
 -  Pacific Northwest University of Health Sciences (PNWU), Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine;
 -  Heritage University (HU), Physician Assistant Program and Nursing Program;
 -  Washington State University (WSU), Nursing Program and Pharmacy Program;
 -  Central Washington University (CWU), Paramedicine Program and Dietetics Program;
 -  Washington State Allied Health Center of Excellence, located at Yakima Valley College
 The current PNWU College of Osteopathic Medicine (COM) curriculum includes CLIN 618, which is a second year requirement and presents a multidimensional approach to the understanding of the most common clinical entities in psychiatry and behavioral medicine. Third and fourth year courses includes BEHCS 701 Behavioral Medicine rotation which is designed for students to learn and practice skills necessary for working with patients in a mental health setting.
 Incorporating the COIF via telesimulation would give students, residents, and faculty the experience for use beyond course requirements and prepare them for the future of healthcare."

 Worldwide, depression carries a significant burden. Although there are effective treatments for depression, many patients do not achieve remission, and any significant response usually occurs after a few weeks. The common approach for a rapid intervention in cases of severe depressive symptoms has been electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). There are drawbacks to ECT including a prior medical work-up, general anaesthesia, and the possibility of memory loss.
 Further, access to ECT is often limited. Comparatively, the most striking breakthrough in the field of mood disorders has been the rapid antidepressant effects of intravenous ketamine.
 The antidepressant response to ketamine often occurs within a few hours, and peaks within 24.
 Recent studies have documented that the benefits of ketamine can be sustained with repeated administration.
 This longitudinal, multi-centre, randomized, crossover clinical trial is funded in part by the Ontario Brain Institute through a sponsorship with the Canadian Biomarker Integration
 Network in Depression (CAN-BIND) research program. It will take place across five sites: the
 Royal Ottawa Mental Health Centre (lead site), Douglas Mental Health University Institute,
 Providence Care Hospital, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre and University Health Network.
 A total of 240 participants (accounting for 20% dropout) will be recruited over 30 months from ECT wait lists across the five sites and randomized to either the ketamine or ECT treatment arm. Participants in the ketamine treatment arm will receive 0.5 mg/kg IV over 40 minutes in the recovery room of the ECT clinic as per the study schedule. Participants in the
 ECT treatment arm will receive ECT as per the study schedule and as decided by their treating physician. Each participant will be enrolled in the study for between six weeks and nine months, or until they leave the study or the study is terminated.
 Throughout the study, clinical, neuroimaging, molecular, and cognitive assessments will be conducted. Data will be collected using the Ontario Brain Institute's Centre for Ontario Data
 Exploration and Research Electronic Data Capture in order to coordinate data from the five sites.
 Participants randomized to the either treatment arm will receive thrice weekly treatments for 3 or 4 weeks for a total of 9 or 12 treatments respectively. Following the randomization phase, responders may move to the maintenance phase and non-responders may move to the crossover phase where they will receive the alternate therapy. During the crossover phase, participants will receive thrice weekly treatments for 3 or 4 weeks for a total of 9 or 12 treatments respectively. Following the crossover phase, responders will move to the maintenance phase and non-responders will exit the study. During the maintenance phase, participants who achieved response with ketamine will receive weekly ketamine treatments for one month, treatment once every two weeks for two months, and monthly treatment for three months. Should participants in the ketamine arm relapse during monthly treatment, they may return to treatments once every two weeks. Participants who achieved response in the ECT arm will receive ECT treatment for six months based on decision of the treating physician in order to maintain a clinical response. Both treatment arms will have a follow-up visit during month seven.
 The aim of this study is to show that compared to ECT, ketamine treatment produces faster therapeutic action, has less side effects, requires fewer/shorter hospitalizations for patients, and will be less expensive because it does not require an anaesthesiologist and a psychiatrist to administer the various ECT protocols. Through the discovery of biomarkers to predict ECT or ketamine response or non-response, the anticipated effective treatment could be administered as a first line intervention for a subgroup of depressed patients, thereby ensuring a more time-efficient intervention."

 Aim: To evaluate the effect of a soluble fibre supplement in glucose metabolism in pregnant women at high risk of developing gestational diabetes.
 Study methodology: 12 week randomised, placebo-controlled, single-blinded study.
 Intervention: Women will first be categorised according to their glycaemic status into two groups: GDM and glucose tolerant women. Afterwards, each group will be randomised into two groups and given either 1. Fibre supplement (Guar gum) 2. Placebo (Cellulose) The participants will take the dietary supplement three times a day for 12 weeks. They will receive regular antenatal control according to NICE guidelines recommendations. Compliance will be addressed by weekly phone calls.
 Number of volunteers: The number of participants will be arbitrarily define as no data of this type of intervention exists in this cohort. 40 participants will be recruited. Previous studies, outside pregnancy, have observed metabolic effects in samples of 15-40 subjects.
 Recruitment: Women will be recruited in the antenatal clinic at Queen Charlotte and Chelsea's
 Hospital. An information sheet will be provided to eligible women in the first antenatal visit to explain the purposes of the study. Women who decide to take part will be asked to sign a consent form.
 Randomisation: Initially women will be categorised according to glycaemic status in two cohorts: Glucose tolerant and Early gestational diabetes (GDM) cohort. Each of the two cohorts will then be independently randomised to either intervention or standard care using the sealed envelope website. Guar gum (intervention) and cellulose (placebo) will be provided in identical packed sachets.
 STUDY OUTCOME MEASURES
 PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES
 -  Glucose values at 0 and 120 minutes during an OGTT performed at 28 weeks in the glucose tolerant group.
 -  Glycaemic control assessed by need of insulin treatment (yes/no), days to insulin treatment and total insulin dose.
 SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES
 Assessing insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion at 28 weeks of pregnancy in the glucose tolerant cohort of women through validated indices using glucose and insulin (or C-peptide) values derived from the OGTT.
 -  Insulin sensitivity will be assessed using the Matsuda formula (18).
 -  Insulin secretion will be assessed by second-void fasting UCPCR as described by McDonald et al (19).
 In the gestational diabetes cohort, where a second OGTT will not be performed, parameters of insulin resistance (HOMA_IR index) and secretion could be assessed using urinary C-peptide obtained from a fasting second-void urine sample at 28 weeks gestation, as described by Oram (20), although these measurements have not been validated in pregnancy. 6. ASSESSMENT AND FOLLOW UP Women will be assess by the researchers at four different visits.
 At the first antenatal visit, the general care team will mentioned the study, if the patient consents, she will then be approached by the researchers to explain the study protocol. At the second visit, when the OGTT is performed, women who decided to take part in the study will sign the consent from. At the next antenatal visit where results from the OGTT are explained, women included will be randomised. The last research visit will take place at 28 weeks gestation. Additionally, they will be contacted weekly, by telephone to assess compliance and confirm willingness to participate in the study. All participating women will continue to attend routine follow up by the Obstetrics team at the antenatal clinic. Women diagnosed with GDM in early pregnancy will continue their routine care under the Obstetric team at Queen Charlotte's Hospital. We will be collecting information regarding treatment from the notes taken at this follow-up visits. 1. st visit (≤16 weeks gestation) Women with a previous history of GDM will be considered at high risk of recurrence and will be referred to the antenatal clinic before 16 weeks of pregnancy. At this first visit, the direct care team will inform them about the study and ask them if they are willing to speak with a member of the research team. If they agree, a research team member will explain the protocol and invite them to participate in the study. An information sheet will be provided and women will have time to consider if they are willing to participate and inform the research team at their next antenatal visit. 2. nd visit Women who decide to participate will inform the research team when they attend their second antenatal visit, when an OGTT is to be performed. In this visit, women willing to participate will be asked to sign a consent form.
 As part of the standard pregnancy care, these women will be booked for GDM early screening. The following investigations will be performed as part of their usual NHS care:
 -  Blood tests: full blood count, renal function. GAD antibodies can be requested in women in whom type 1 diabetes is suspected.
 -  Urine sample to test for proteinuria, glycosuria, leucocytes and nitrates.
 -  Women willing to participate in the study will be additionally requested to provide a second urine sample after the 120 min during the OGTT. When bloods are taken will also request HbA1c as part of the study's investigations.
 -  An OGTT to test for early GDM will be performed as part of routine care. During the
 OGTT blood samples are taken at 0 and 120 minutes. Additionally to glucose, which is normally measure during the OGTT, for study purposes we will request serum
 C-peptide at these time points.
 Baseline insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion will be estimated through validated indices using serum glucose, insulin (or C-peptide) and urinary C-peptide.
 After the participants have agreed to take part in the study and consent has been signed, data regarding anthropometrics, demographics and medical history will be collected. This information will be obtained by reviewing the participant's medical notes.
 Anthropometric measurements will be recorded at the first antenatal routine visit, including: pre-pregnancy weight, weight at first visit and height. BMI will be calculated with this data.
 Demographics, personal and medical history will be extracted from medical records, including: maternal age, ethnicity, education, smoking during pregnancy, medical history (hypertension, PCOS, other relevant condition), obstetric history (parity, stillbirth, macrosomia, pre-eclampsia). 3. rd visit (Randomisation)
 After obtaining the results from the OGTT, women will be categorised by their glycaemic status and divided into two independent cohorts:
 -  Women diagnosed with gestational diabetes (according to NICE guidelines 2015 diagnostic criteria): early GDM cohort
 -  Women with normal glucose tolerance or impaired glucose tolerance but not fulfilling GDM criteria: Glucose tolerant cohort.
 Women from each cohort will be randomised into two groups after the results of the OGTT are obtained:
 -  Intervention group: Guar gum fibre supplement
 -  Placebo group: Cellulose supplement Women will the fibre supplement 3 times a day (with each main meal) until the 28th week of pregnancy when they will be re-evaluated. 4. rd visit (28th weeks gestation)
 Glycaemic status will be assessed at 28 weeks gestation in the two cohorts of women participating in the study:
 -  Women from the Glucose tolerant cohort will undergo a second OGTT. Blood and urine samples will be collected at 0 and 120 minutes. Glycaemic status will then be assessed with the endpoint being the diagnosis of GDM (yes/no). Insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion will be estimated using the same parameters as in the first visit. As part of the study, women will be weight to calculate BMI and gestational weight gain at 28 weeks gestation. The research team will have their last face to face visit with the participant to discontinue the intervention and answer any potential questions about the study.
 -  In women in the Early GDM cohort, glycaemic control will be assessed by the need of insulin treatment (yes/no) and in those requiring insulin the days-to-treatment (insulin) and total insulin dose will be recorded. Data will be obtained by reviewing medical records. As part of the study, women will be weight to calculate BMI and gestational weight gain at 28 weeks gestation. The research team will have their last face to face visit with the participant to discontinue the intervention and answer any potential questions about the study.
 PROCEDURES Women will be advised to fast for 10 hours the night before the oral glucose tolerance test. They will also be advised no to restrict carbohydrate ingestion the three days prior to the OGTT. At the antenatal clinic, blood samples will be collected at baseline (0 min) and at 120 min after the administration of an oral load of 75 g of glucose.
 In the baseline sample other parameters will also be determined. Creatinine and HbA1c will measure in all participants and GAD antibodies will be requested in women in whom type 1 diabetes is suspected.
 Serum insulin and C-peptide will be collected at 0 and 120 min during the OGTT. Women will be advised to void their first urine before attending the antenatal clinic. Second-void fasting urine sample will be collected at 0 min during the OGTT. A second urine sample will be collected at 120 min. Urinary C-peptide will measure in these samples will be transfer to boric acid containers, the alliquoted into 1 ml cryotubes ans stored at -80 ºC until analysis. Serum creatinine will be collected at baseline (0 min) and measure in the central lab. The urinary C-peptide creatinine ratio (UCPCR) will be calculated using these data.
 ASSESSMENTS (i) Gestational diabetes Gestational diabetes will be diagnosed if fasting plasma glucose
 >5.6 mmol/L and/or 120 min plasma glucose >7.8 mmol/L after the glucose load administered in the OGTT. Women with fasting plasma glucose <5.6 mmol/L and 120 min plasma glucose <7.8 mmol/L will be classified as Glucose tolerant. (ii) Insulin sensitivity Insulin sensitivity will be assessed using the Matsuda index as originally described (18) (Equation 1) and using two modified Matsuda equations in which insulin is substitute by either serum or urinary C-peptide (21,22) (Equations 2 and 3).
 Equation 1. ISOGTT= 10,000 / √ {[FPG x fasting insulin] x [mean glucose x mean insulin during
 OGTT]} Equation 2. ISOGTTC-pep=500,000/√{[FPGxFsC-pep] x [mean glucose x mean sC-pep during the OGTT]} Equation 3. ISOGTT-UCPCR=500,000/√{[FPG×FUCPCR pmol/mmol] x [mean glucose x mean
 UCPCR during the OGTT]} (iii) Insulin secretion Insulin secretion will be estimated by the UCPCR obtained using the fasting second-void urine sample, as it is strongly correlated with serum insulin, serum
 C-peptide (19) and 24-h urinary C-peptide (20).
 Insulin response will be estimated using the UCPCR calculated with 120 min post-OGTT urine sample, as it is strongly correlated with the C-peptide and insulin area under the curve (19). (iv) Need of insulin treatment, Days to insulin treatment and Total insulin dose Medical records of women in the Early GDM cohort will be review in order to determine the need of insulin treatment (yes/no) at 28 weeks gestation. In women requiring insulin treatment at any time during follow up, days-to-insulin treatment, calculated from randomisation day to the day insulin treatment is prescribed, and total insulin dose, calculated as the total dose of insulin international units (IU) divided by weight in Kg (insulin UI/Kg), will be recorded 7.

 WITHDRAWAL CRITERIA Participants will be free to withdraw at any time and are not required to give a reason. 8. ADVERSE EVENTS Adverse Event (AE): Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical study subject.
 Serious Adverse Event (SAE): Any untoward and unexpected medical occurrence that: results in death, is life- threatening, requires hospitalisation, results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity or a congenital abnormality or birth defect
 Medical judgement should be exercised in deciding whether an AE is serious in other situations. Important AEs that are not immediately life threatening or do not result in death or hospitalisation but may jeopardise the subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above, should also be considered serious.
 REPORTING PROCEDURES All adverse events should be reported. Depending on the nature of the event the reporting procedures below should be followed. Any questions concerning adverse event reporting should be directed to the Chief Investigator in the first instance.
 Non serious AEs All such events, whether expected or not, should be recorded.
 Serious AEs An SAE form should be completed and faxed to the Chief Investigator within 24 hours. However, relapse, death and hospitalisations for elective treatment of a pre-existing condition do not need reporting as SAEs. All SAEs should be reported to the sponsor.
 All SAEs should be reported to the Bromley Research Ethics Committee where in the opinion of the Chief Investigator the event was:
 'Related', i.e. resulted from the administration of any of the research procedures; and
 'Unexpected', i.e. an event that is not listed in the protocol as an expected occurrence.
 Reports of related and unexpected SAEs should be submitted within 15 days of the Chief
 Investigator becoming aware of the event, using the NRES SAE form for non-IMP studies.
 Local investigators should report any SAEs as required by their Local Research Ethics
 Committee and/ or Research and Development Office. 9. STATISTICS AND DATA ANALYSIS Data handling and analysis will be carried out by SPSS version 20.0 version. No power calculation to decide sample size will be used. The number of participants has been arbitrarily defined, as it is a pilot study. We aim to recruit 40 women.
 Before randomisation, women will be categorised according to their glycaemic status in two cohorts: Glucose tolerant and GDM. Each of these two cohorts will be randomly allocated into the intervention (soluble fibre supplement) and control (placebo) group. Randomisation will be by sealed envelopes. Participants but not researchers will be blinded as to the type of intervention prescribed.
 Differences between group en each cohort will be assessed using Student t test or
 Mann-Whitney U test for numeric variables depending on distribution; X2 will be used for categorical variables.
 In the Glucose tolerant women cohort:
 For the primary outcome, GDM (yes/no), logistic regression analysis will be performed.
 For the secondary outcomes, insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion, linear regression analysis will be performed.
 In the early GDM cohort:
 For the primary outcome, need for insulin treatment (yes/no), logistic regression analysis will be performed. Additionally days-to-treatment analysis will be performed for those participants starting insulin therapy during follow up."

 In previous literature it has been shown that compared to placebo, IV acetaminophen can improve postoperative pain scores and reduce opioid requirements. In addition, IV acetaminophen has several pharmacokinetic properties that may be beneficial when compared to acetaminophen. IV acetaminophen has been shown to achieve a more rapid and higher maximum plasma concentration as well as higher cerebrospinal fluid concentrations. Comparative effectiveness trials of IV vs PO administration have not conclusively demonstrated improved clinical outcomes despite the proposed pharmacokinetic benefits.

 Objective
 This protocol is being performed to 1) characterize the clinical and 2) immunological response of patients with recurrent glioblastoma to treatment with Nivolumab, together with an anti-Lag-3 antibody, BMS-986016, and to evaluate the safety of brain tumor microdialysis in this patient population.
 Study Population 10 patients (total, after replacement for any dropout), 18 years old and older with recurrence of glioblastoma after standard treatment of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation.
 Study Design
 Patients will be screened by study neurosurgeons or neuro-oncologists to verify their confirmed or likely diagnosis of a recurrent glioblastoma. Patients will be offered standard of care therapy, including repeat surgery and/or recommendations for chemotherapeutic agents and other trials. If the patients are deemed to be surgical candidates for their potential recurrence, they will be enrolled in the trial. Enrolled patients will then undergo a stereotactic brain biopsy. If a frozen section confirms a diagnosis of recurrent glioblastoma, two microdialysis catheters will be placed in the brain after the biopsy, and a lumbar drain will also be placed. These microdialysis catheters will sample interstitial fluid in and around the brain tumor every 6 hours. We will concurrently collect blood and cerebral spinal fluid samples for comparison. After two days (Day 3), the patients will be given one dose of Nivolumab, 240mg IV. We will continue to collect samples every six hours for 5 additional days, after which patients will undergo surgical resection of their tumors and removal of the microdialysis catheters and lumbar drain. Nivolumab, at a dose of 240mg IV over 30 minutes every 2 weeks, will be administered after surgery (starting on Day 17, two weeks after the first dose on Day 3) followed by BMS 986016, an anti-Lag-3 antibody at a dose of 80mg IV over 60 minutes, until the study neuroradiologist notes tumor progression on MRI or the patient experiences treatment toxicity. While on therapy with Nivolumab and
 BMS-986016, patients will be seen and examined every 2 weeks +/- two days for signs of toxicity. Patients will be followed for at least three months after the surgical procedure.
 Outcome Measures
 The primary outcome measures are the proportion of patients who have a measurable increase of interferon gamma levels in the brain tumor tissue after their first dose of Nivolumab as compared to the pre-treatment baseline, the safety of using brain tumor microdialysis to monitor response to immune modulators in patients with recurrent glioblastoma and the safety of the combination of Nivolumab and BMS-986016. Secondary outcome measures include: 1) To determine the change in interferon gamma production within the tumor microenvironment and in the rest of the body from before and after therapy with the immune checkpoint inhibitor, nivolumab; 2) To evaluate the pathological response of the immune microenvironment of brain tumor tissue to the first dose of Nivolumab; 3) To evaluate the clinical response (progression free survival, overall survival) of recurrent glioblastoma patients to this treatment combination; 4) To describe the difference in survival between responders and non-responders on this treatment combination; 5) To examine the differences in the immune cells and secreted factors of the tumor environment as compared to the immune cells and secreted factors of the cerebral spinal fluid, blood and, potentially, bone marrow in response to this treatment."

 This is an open label, prospective cohort study of 10 people with ALS (PALS) from the Duke
 ALS Clinic. The first 5 enrolled PALS (Group 1) will receive standard ALS care for the first month, then standard care plus Triheptanoin for the next 5 months. The next 5 enrolled PALS (Group 2) will receive standard ALS care plus Triheptanoin for 6 months (Figure 1). All Group 1 and Group 2 PALS who complete this 6-month study will have an option for Triheptanoin treatment extension for an additional 12 months. In addition to the PALS, there will also be 5 healthy controls enrolled (Group 3), people that do not have ALS or any other neurodegenerative disease). These participants will not receive any treatment; the only outcome measure they will complete is serum and urine biomarker testing at screening/baseline, month 1 and month 6.
 The rationale for delaying triheptanoin treatment in one group is to look for differences in
 MR spectroscopy related to treatment at the 1 month time point. The target triheptanoin dose for this study is 1g/kg/d. This target dose was selected because it was safe and tolerable and altered brain MR spectroscopy in patients with Huntington's Disease. Participants will taper up to this dose as follows: start at 0.25g/kg/d for 1 week, then take 0.5g/kg/d for 1 week, then take 1g/kg/d and stay on this dose for the duration of the study. Triheptanoin will be administered orally with food or by gastrostomy tube over 3 divided doses (breakfast, lunch, and dinner). If at any point after week 1 a participant does not appear to be tolerating their current dose, it will be reduced by 0.25g/kg/d. If they cannot tolerate the starting dose of 0.25g/kg/d, the treatment will be discontinued. A dietician will make contact with all participants every month, either in person or by telephone, to try and maximize compliance.
 The primary outcome measure is the ALSFRS-R score obtained monthly for all treated participants (in person at screening/baseline, month 1, month 3 and month 6; via telephone at months 2, 4 and 5). We will also obtain this measure by phone at months 6 and 12 of the extension. For all enrolled PALS in Groups 1 and 2, we will compare the slope of ALSFRS-R progression before enrollment to the slop of ALSFRS-R progression during the trial. ALSFRS-R is a quickly administered (five minute) ordinal rating scale (ratings 0-4) used to determine patients' assessments of their capability and independence in 13 functional activities. All 13 activities are relevant in ALS. Initial validity was established in ALS patients by documenting that their change in ALSFRS-R scores, which correlated with change in strength over time, was closely associated with quality of life measures, and predicted survival. The test-retest reliability is greater than 0.88 for all 13 itemsactivities. The ALSFRS-R declines linearly with time over a wide range during the course of ALS. The minimum clinically significant change in this scale is said to be 20%. The measure can be reliably conducted over the phone.
 Secondary outcome measures include:
 MR Spectroscopy NAA/Cr ratio in motor cortex will be measured at screening/baseline and 1 month time points. This measure declines over time in patients with ALS. This measure can respond to treatment; it was shown to improve over 3 weeks in patients with ALS on riluzole compared to a group that was not on this treatment. We will compare the MR spectroscopy changes over 1 month in Group 1 to the MR spectroscopy changes over 1 month in Group 2.
 A Serum and Urine Biomarker Panel will be obtained at screening/baseline, 1 month and 6-month time points and analyzed using liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. Laboratory, pathologic, and epidemiologic evidence clearly supports the hypothesis that oxidative stress is central in the ALS pathogenic process, particularly in genetically susceptive individuals.
 Oxidative stress biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid, plasma, and urine are elevated, suggesting that abnormal oxidative stress is generated outside of the central nervous system.
 Magnitude of lipid peroxidation, measured as non-enzymatic oxidation products of arachidonic acid, F2-isoprostanes, appears the most obvious oxidative stress marker. We will measure urine F2-isoprostane metabolites (class III: iPF2α-III, and 2,3-dinor iPF-2alpha-III, class
 VI: iPF-2alpha-VI, and 8,12-iso-iPF-2alpha-VI), urine creatinine, and serum and urine glutamate, a-keto-glutarate, NADH, coenzyme A levels in all treated participants and healthy controls at screening/baseline, month 1 and month 6 time points. We will compare the biomarker changes at different times points across between Groups 1, 2 and 3.
 For safety monitoring:, concomitant medications, vital signs, weight, physical exam and safety labs (CBC, CMP, Lipid Profile, GGT, LFT and pregnancy testing for sexually active females with child bearing potential) will be measured at screening/baseline, 1 month, 3 month, and 6-month time points. Adverse events will be monitored continuously throughout the study, as described in Section 5.1.
 The primary statistical analysis is the slope of the revised ALS functional rating scale (ALSFRS-R) during treatment compared to pre-treatment. Pre-treatment slope for each participant will be estimated as follows: (48-enrollment ALSFRS-R)/months since symptom onset. This frequently used pre-slope method is simple and inexpensive, and can predict disease progression as well as more complicated and expensive tools, at least for periods of less than 1 year."

 The aim of this study is compare the amount of post-operative pain relief provided by two different methods of local anaesthetic injection techniques used in total knee replacement surgery.
 'Enhanced Recovery After Surgery' protocols has significantly shortened recovery-time and length of hospital admission after total knee replacement (TKR). A major factor in this improvement has been the incorporation of multi- modal therapies which deliver adequate pain relief, limit post-operative nausea and enable early mobilisation.
 Peripheral nerve blocks are performed by the anaesthetist immediately prior to surgery. This involves injecting local anaesthetic around the nerves which supply sensation around the knee. Injecting directly into the nerve can damage it and lead to significant disability. For this reason peripheral nerve blocks are often performed under ultrasound guidance. This can be time-consuming and does not negate the risk of nerve injury.
 Peri-articular infiltration is performed during the operation by the surgeon. In the knee this involves injecting a solution of local anaesthetic into multiple specified soft-tissue and bony regions around the knee. It is performed blind without ultrasound guidance and also carries risk of nerve injury.
 Intra-articular injections involve the surgeon injecting local anaesthetic solution into the knee joint itself. During TKR, this can be performed after closure of the joint capsule immediately prior to skin closure. This avoids risks to nerves and arteries as it is placed into the large knee joint, and not blindly around the joint capsule. In addition, it is simple to perform and less time-consuming than peri-articular infiltration.
 Randomised controlled trials have previously compared femoral (peripheral) nerve blocks to periarticular infiltration, periarticular infiltration with and without posterior capsule infiltration, and periarticular infiltration to the front versus the back of the knee.
 However, to our knowledge the technique of intra-articular injection has not been compared to peri- articular infiltration for immediate post-operative analgesia following total knee arthroplasty
 Study Design A double-blind randomised controlled trial (RCT) will be conducted in a single hospital, with four Consultant Knee Surgeons recruiting patients. It is anticipated from a previous RCT performed at the same centre, that recruitment be completed within 2 years.
 Participants All patients undergoing primary total knee replacement for osteoarthritis under the care of 4 Consultant Orthopaedic Surgeons at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh will be assessed for eligibility for study enrolment.
 All patients will receive trial information (patient information sheet) when they are placed on the waiting list for TKR. Patients currently wait 12 weeks for surgery. When patients are reviewed at a pre-assessment clinic 2-4 weeks prior surgery, those who fulfil the inclusion criteria will have the trial explained in full by the research team, supervised by the lead investigator Ms Chloe Scott, and will decide whether they wish to be involved. Informed consent will be obtained at this stage. Patients will then have 2-4 weeks before surgery to opt out of the study if they wish.
 Power Calculation Audit of 10 TKR patients measuring VAS pain scores at 6 and 24 hours has demonstrated a standard deviation of 2.14 points. The minimum clinically important difference (MCID) for this score is 12mm (1.2 points). Assuming approximate normality for the VAS, primary outcome data on 102 patients (51 in each arm) will be required for 80% power at 5% significance. Allowing for a dropout rate of 10%, 120 patients will be recruited.
 Randomization A total of 120 participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either
 Treatment Group 1 (periarticular infiltration) or Treatment Group 2 (intraarticular injection) using the sealed opaque envelope randomization technique. This will be performed after spinal anaesthetic has been administered before surgery commences.
 Baseline information All patients will be initially evaluated with a complete history and physical examination. For all patients entering the study the following baseline information will be recorded: Age, sex, BMI, Kellgren-Lawrence grade of osteoarthritis, preoperative analgesia regime, length of knee pain duration, employment status, and postcode. Baseline VAS
 Pain scores, Oxford Knee Scores and EQ-5D scores will be collected as is routine for all of our arthroplasty patients.
 Peri-operative Protocol All patients will be admitted on the day of surgery and undergo a standardised enhanced recovery anaesthetic protocol including spinal anaesthetic (with no intrathecal diamorphine) and no peripheral nerve blocks (femoral, sciatic or adductor canal).
 All patients will undergo a cemented Triathlon (Stryker, Mahwah, NJ, USA) cruciate retaining
 TKR.
 All patients will be prescribed standardised post-operative analgesia including Oxycodone MR 15mg twice daily for 4 doses with stepdown to weaker opiate, usually Cocodamol 30/500 2 tabs 4 times per day, Oxycodone IR 5-10mg prn for breakthrough pain.
 Patients will be placed first or second on the operating list to enable VAS pain scores to be collected at the assigned times.
 Multimodal injection The injection will consist of the same drugs for all patients: 150mg levobupivacaine 0.25%, 10mg morphine; and 30mg ketorolac made up to a volume of 150ml with saline.
 The difference between treatment groups is how the multimodal injection is administered: either by periarticular infiltration around the knee, or by simple intra-articular injection after the knee joint capsule has been closed.
 Treatment group 1: Periarticular infiltration
 Intra-operatively after bone cuts have been made and prior to implant cementation, the multimodal injection will be infiltrated around the knee at 6 specific sites: 1. Medial femoral condyle periosteum 2. Medial gutter 3. Lateral femoral condyle periosteum 4. Lateral gutter 5. Posteromedial capsule 6. Posterolateral capsule
 Treatment Group 2: Intra-articular infiltration After implant cementation and watertight joint capsular closure, the multimodal injection will be injected intra-articularly through the closed capsule.
 Post-operative protocol and Follow-up Postoperatively patients will complete a VAS pain score at 6, 12 24 and 48 hours postoperatively with research staff blinded to the infiltration technique employed. All analgesia required in the first 24 hours will be recorded and an opiate equivalency dose calculator used to determine opiate intake (Joint Formulary Committee 2016). At 48 hours, in addition to recording a VAS pain score, patients will be asked how satisfied they were with their pain relief as scored on a 5 point Likert score from very satisfied to very dissatisfied.
 Patients will then undergo routine postoperative management with review by arthroplasty practitioners blinded to their treatment arm at 6 weeks where they will be examined and will be asked to complete an adverse events questionnaire.
 Patient reported outcomes including Oxford Knee Scores and EQ-5D scores will be collected as standard at 12 months."

 Heart failure is a leading cause of death, hospitalisation, impaired quality of life and health expenditure. Symptoms and survival can be significantly improved by implantation of a device for Cardiac Resynchronisation Therapy (CRT). CRT devices are available as biventricular pacemakers (CRT-P) or as significantly more complex and cost-intensive biventricular defibrillators (CRT-D).
 In patients who have previously experienced a life-threatening arrhythmia, the choice of the
 CRT-D (and not the CRT-P) is imperative but these are a small minority of patients. For the vast majority of patients receiving CRT therapy, there is currently considerable uncertainty as to whether the defibrillator function is needed and whether its benefits outweigh its risks. The defibrillator function may protect patients from sudden cardiac death. On the other hand, device-associated complications such as device infections appear to be increased; furthermore the defibrillator comes along with specific adverse events, particularly inappropriate shocks. These shocks are common and not only traumatic to patients (potentially leading to post-traumatic stress syndrome, anxiety disorders and depression), they also are negatively associated with overall survival.
 The objective of the trial is to demonstrate that in patients with chronic heart failure who receive optimal medical treatment for this condition and have indication for CRT, the implantation of a CRT-P (index group) is not inferior to CRT-D (control group) with respect to all-cause mortality. Patients with an indication for CRT will be randomised to CRT-P or
 CRT-D.
 RESET-CRT is an event-driven trial with a planned number of randomised and treated patients of n=2,030 and of 361 primary endpoints within an estimated median follow-up period of 21 months.
 No investigational medical product is defined to be used within RESET-CRT since only the therapeutic strategy (CRT-D versus CRT-P) is a pre-defined study treatment and allocated by random group (Proof of Strategy Trial). The devices to be implanted will be decided by the treating physician on the basis of the situation of the individual study patient and in line with local policies in routine clinical care.
 Total study duration:
 Enrolment of 24 months. All patients will be followed until 361 valid primary endpoints are reached (event-driven trial) which is expected about 10 months after last patient in. Total study duration of 35 months (about 3 years) is expected which might be adapted based on blinded interim analysis of the overall occurrence of the primary endpoint.
 Individual study duration:
 Expected mean follow-up time will be about 21 months per patient with a minimum follow-up time of 10 months and a maximum follow-up time of presumably 35 months."

 Ischemic heart disease is worldwide the single most frequent cause of death. The number of patients surviving acute myocardial injury is increasing due to improved acute treatment.
 However, after the initial repair, the tissue undergoes a remodeling phase to compensate for the damaged area. This re-modeling phase can change the structure end geometry of the heart resulting in lower ejection fraction, leading to cardiac dysfunction, which eventually leads to heart failure. Ischemic heart disease is most commently caused by arteriosclerosis of the coronary artery.
 If chronic ischemic heart disease is left untreated, it will lead to symptoms to the patient.
 These symptons occur when the myocardiel oxygen demand exceeds the oxygen provided, due to coronary occlusion.
 If the heart suffers from ischemia, the tissue reacts strongly to the hypoxia. The body will as a compensatory mechanism create new vessel to provide the tissue with oxygen. This is known as the biological process of angiogenesis. This complex process involves different angiogenic and pro-fibrotic transcription factors that initiate the restoration of capillaries by sprouting from the existing endothelial cells in response to hypoxia.
 Integrin αvβ3 is a transmembrane cell surface receptor that is markedly upregulated in states of angiogenesis. It facilitates migration and proliferation and thereby allowing cells to respond to extracellular environment. Integrin αvβ3 is thus a key player in the angiogenic process. The integrin αvβ3 has a binding site for an RGD peptide (Arg-Gly-Asp motif) and this can be targeted by PET tracers.
 RGD-based PET tracers have been shown to accumulate at the site of myocardial necrosis in both human and animal studies. The uptake before interventions may correlate to recovery of cardiac function and thus serve as a prognostic marker after intervention."

 Primary Objective
 Does a brief cognitive behavioural intervention for post-stroke fatigue lead to clinically relevant improvements in fatigue after 6 months? Fatigue will be assessed using the self-reported Fatigue Assessment Scale (FAS) which has been validated for use in stroke (14).
 This scale includes both mental and physical fatigue. Our data shows that a difference of approximately 5 points in FAS was associated with a clinically significant difference in people with stroke (15); the literature on stroke patients suggests that a difference in four points on the scale is considered to be 'clinically relevant'. We are conservatively basing our power calculations on a difference between groups of four points in the FAS.
 Secondary Objectives
 -  Does the intervention improve fatigue at 4 months (i.e. immediately after the end of the intervention)?
 -  Does the intervention improve self-reported mood at 4 months and 6 months? This will be assessed using Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) (16) and the Generalised Anxiety
 Disorder (GAD7) (17). At 6 months we will also enquire whether antidepressants or anxiolytics have been prescribed.
 -  Does the intervention improve stroke specific quality of life including patient reported social participation? This will be assessed using the Modified Short Form of the Stroke
 Impact Scale (18).
 -  What is the cost of the intervention, and what is the quality of life adjusted life years (QUALYS)? To assess QUALYS, we will use the Euroquol 5D (5 level version) (21).
 -  Has the patient returned to work? If so are they working the same hours as prestroke?
 Endpoints
 Primary Endpoint
 The primary outcome is the Fatigue Assessment Scale (19) at 6 months after randomisation. The
 FAS is a 10-item self-report scale with 10 statements about different aspects of fatigue, each rated from 1 to 5 (1, never; 2, sometimes; 3, regularly; 4, often; and 5, always). It is valid and reliable in stroke(14). A higher score indicates more fatigue. A difference of four points is considered to be clinically relevant.
 Secondary Endpoints
 To answer our secondary objectives, we will collect the following outcome measures
 -  PHQ-9 and GAD-7 (4 months and 6 months after randomisation).
 -  Modified Short Form of the Stroke Impact Scale (6 months after randomisation) (18).
 -  At 4 months and 6 months after randomisation: The EuroQol (EQ-5D-5L) to provide an overall measure of health related quality of life (HRQOL) and to allow a health economic analysis based on quality adjusted life years ((20)). As repeated measures of the
 EQ-5D-5L are required for assessment of QUALYS; this will be done at baseline, 4 months and 6 months.
 -  Health costs (Between randomisation and 6 months) For this health economic analysis, we will collect data on costs (visits to the GP, number of admissions to hospital, days in a care home, number of visits from social carers, cost of the therapist delivery time, cost of the supervision time from psychology/psychiatry). This will enable us to perform a health economic analysis which will tell us how much the intervention costs, whether there are savings in usage of health/social care, and what QUALYS are associated with the intervention.
 -  We will ask the patient to list their medication. We will note any new prescriptions of anxiolytics or antidepressants"

 Congenital adrenal hyperplasia in its severe salt-wasting form is a challenge in order to maintain sodium balance. The pathophysiology of this impaired sodium balance is still poorly investigated as well as its therapeutic management, notably in the neonatal period. Consensus practice guidelines have been established for hydrocortisone replacement therapy, in order to maintain negative feedback on the pituitary-adrenal axis to prevent from virilization and excessive growth velocity. However, mineralocorticoid substitution and sodium supplementation is currently empirically adapted based on weight gain and renin levels. There is significant need for improvement of this essential part of CAH treatment. Particularly, CAH patients have higher risk of adverse cardio-vascular outcomes, which could relate to an excessive glucocorticoid and/or mineralocorticoid exposure in early infancy rather than to the genotype of the patient.
 A clinical human study in classical CAH neonates, using Liquid Chromatography coupled to tandem Mass Spectrometry LC-MS/MS technology will assess prospectively plasma and urinary steroid profiling (precursors and substitute hormones, notably Fludrocortisone dosages) during the first six months of life, before and under treatment; and in correlation with genotype.
 Thirty neonates (boys and girls) diagnosed with a severe form of CAH and followed in one of the 5 following French reference tertiary centers: Robert Debré Hospital, Paris; Necker
 Hospital, Paris; Bicetre Hospital, Le Kremlin-Bicetre; Trousseau Hospital, Paris; Lyon
 Hospital, , will be included in the study and will be followed for a period of six months.

 Investigators will recruit babies who are in the Neonatal Unit at St. Peter's Hospital.
 Babies will be clinically stable from a cardio-respiratory point of view. They will also be requiring incubator care (so they will weigh less than approximately 1400g) but not requiring additional humidification. This effectively excludes babies born less than 30 weeks gestation who are routinely humidified for the first week (if 28-30 weeks gestation) or two weeks (if less than 28 weeks gestation). Some term babies may also be eligible for the study if they are being nursed in an incubator for clinical reasons.
 Identification and recruitment of babies will be carried out by the attending Consultant
 Neonatologist and the research team.
 For twins, consecutive enrolment will be possible if only one mOm incubator is available.
 There will be two arms to the protocol. The first arm will consist of standard incubator care, where the care of the baby is unchanged, but non-invasive, more frequent (hourly) temperature and other physiological measures of stability than would normally be collected in routine care (nominally every three hours) will be collected. The second arm will be the baby receiving normal care in the mOm incubator, with another set of hourly detailed, non-invasive, observations. The planned care and monitoring of the baby will be otherwise unchanged. No additional blood tests or any other invasive testing or monitoring are required. The clinical team will have full control and responsibility for the baby's care and can terminate the study for the baby at any time for any reason.
 In addition, investigators will collect the views of staff on the baby's comfort, visibility, care, usability and acceptability during each arm of the study.
 For each arm of the study, the secondary outcome measures are: (1) pulse rate (as a measure of clinical stability) (2) respiratory rate (as a measure of clinical stability) (3) apnea and bradycardia episodes recorded by nursing staff (clinical stability) (4) temperature (as a measure of clinical stability) (4) adverse events related to incubator performance (5) cleaning ease and time took (6) set up time (7) staff structured feedback 36 eligible babies will be recruited into the study at a single site, being identified by the clinical team.

Babies will act as their own controls in this cross-over study design. If any babies fail to complete the 48-hour study procedures (e.g. due to data incomplete or baby withdrawn) further babies will be recruited to achieve 36 complete datasets."

 Treadmill exercise capacity and other physiologic responses to leg exercise are powerful predictors of mortality and provide important clinical and diagnostic information. However, many Veterans cannot perform treadmill exercise because of lower extremity or other disabilities. For many years, pharmacologic myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) has been the standard of care for their evaluation but fails to provide powerful prognostic and clinically relevant information of exercise testing, requires exposure to ionizing radiation, and is several times more expensive than exercise electrocardiography (ECG). With a recently completed Merit Review award, we obtained substantial retrospective observational evidence that arm exercise ECG stress testing scores are at least equivalent to pharmacologic MPI for robust prediction of mortality and other measures of clinical outcome in Veterans who cannot perform leg exercise. Major hypotheses for the current proposal are: 1) arm exercise ECG stress testing scores or best fit models without or with coronary artery calcium scoring (-/+
 CACS) are non-inferior to the Duke Treadmill Score -/+ CACS, best fit model treadmill ECG and regadenoson (r) MPI stress testing, all performed in the same Veterans in randomized order, as an initial evaluation for obstructive coronary artery disease (oCAD), and 2) arm exercise
 ECG stress testing scores or best fit models -/+ CACS are non-inferior to the Duke Treadmill
 Score -/+ CACS, best fit model treadmill ECG and rMPI stress testing in the same Veterans for predicting the primary clinical endpoint (composite of cardiovascular (CV) mortality, myocardial infarction, or 90-day post-stress test coronary revascularization) and secondary clinical endpoints of all-cause mortality and CV mortality. Our specific aim for all Veterans referred to the St. Louis Veterans Administration (VA) stress testing laboratory and are without exclusions for exercise or regadenoson stress testing or cardiac computed tomographic angiography (CTA), is to perform a single site prospective clinical trial comparing arm exercise ECG stress test scores and best models -/+ CACS with the Duke Treadmill Score -/+
 CACS if able to perform treadmill exercise, and best fit treadmill ECG and rMPI models, all performed in the same Veterans, for identification of the diagnostic endpoint of oCAD, defined as a severely ( 70%) occluded epicardial, graft, or 50% left main coronary artery lumen, determined by cardiac CTA or invasive coronary arteriography, and prediction of the primary and secondary clinical endpoints described above. The arm exercise scoring system to be evaluated incorporates the variables arm exercise capacity in resting metabolic equivalents, 1-minute heart rate recovery and arm exercise-induced ST depression of 1 mm or greater. Regadenoson MPI variables to be evaluated include an abnormal MPI study and best fit models of summed stress and difference scores, transient ischemic dilatation, gated left ventricular ejection fraction, and the heart rate response. We plan to enroll 75 Veterans per year for 4 years and follow the entire cohort for an additional year. Statistical analyses will be performed with SAS using univariate and multivariate logistic and Cox regression models. We will evaluate non-inferiority of arm exercise scores -/+ CACS for their association with oCAD and prediction of clinical endpoints with a non-inferiority margin of 0.05. A long term goal is to develop a multi-site prospective randomized VA Cooperative Study to assess generalizability of arm exercise ECG stress testing -/+ CACS for diagnostic and prognostic evaluation in the VA and United States healthcare systems."

 Tumor Sample Collection:
 If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will have surgery to remove a piece of the tumor. The study doctor will discuss this procedure in more detail with you and you will sign a separate consent form explaining the procedure and its risks. You may be admitted to the hospital for this procedure. After the tumor tissue is collected, the sample will be sent to a facility chosen by lovance Biotherapeutics (a company supporting this study) (. At the facility, T-cells will be separated from the tissue and then grown in the facility to create LN-145. This process may take up to 6 weeks. If enough cells cannot be collected or they cannot be grown in the facility, you will not be able to be treated in this study, and other treatment options will be discussed with you. However, you will continue to take part in this study as part of long-term follow-up (described below).
 Study Drug Administration:
 If LN-145 can successfully be created in the facility, you will be hospitalized and begin to receive chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide and fludarabine) to help prepare your body to receive
 LN-145.
 Negative days are days before your LN-145 infusion. Day 0 is the day of your LN- 145 infusion. Positive days are the days after the LN-145 infusion.
 To receive the study drugs, you may be asked to have a central venous catheter (CVC) placed.
 A CVC is a sterile flexible tube that will be placed into a large vein while you are under local anesthesia. Your doctor will explain this procedure to you in more detail, and you will be required to sign a separate consent form.
 You will receive cyclophosphamide by vein over about 2 hours on Days -7 and -6. You will also receive mesna by vein continuously (non-stop) on these days. On Days -5 through -1, you will receive fludarabine by vein over about 30 minutes every day.
 On Day 0, you will receive LN-145 by vein over about 45 minutes.
 After you receive LN-145, you will receive interleukin-2 (IL-2) by vein over about 30 minutes up to 6 times over Days 1-4. IL-2 helps LN-145 to attack the tumor. Your dose of IL-2 may change while you are on study.
 You may be given standard drugs to help decrease the risk of side effects. You may ask the study staff for information about how the drugs are given and their risks.
 You will stay in the hospital for at least 1 week but you may stay in the hospital for as long as the doctor thinks it is needed. You will be discharged from the hospital when the doctor thinks it is safe for you to do so. Length of Study
 You may receive up to 11 days of chemotherapy and 1 infusion of LN-145. You will no longer be able to take the study drug(s) if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions. Your participation on the study will be over after at least 3 years of follow-up.

 Objective: Although the vast majority of alcohol consumption outside the laboratory occurs in social context, experimental studies of alcohol's emotionally reinforcing effects have overwhelmingly examined individuals drinking in isolation. The current study examines motivationally salient elements of everyday social drinking contexts as moderators of alcohol-related reinforcement. More specifically, the present study examine whether alcohol is more reinforcing within the context of unfamiliar vs. familiar social interaction and, further, whether alcohol is more reinforcing within the context of low vs. high quality social relationships. The current study furthermore examine whether individuals with characteristics that put them at risk for developing an alcohol use disorder (e.g., male gender, impulsive/extraverted personality profile, heavy patterns of consumption, family history of AUD, ...) exhibit heightened emotional reinforcement from alcohol within these social drinking contexts.
 The current project represents a test of competing theories of alcohol reinforcement. Alcohol myopia theory—which has heretofore represented the most prominent theory of alcohol's effects—predicts that alcohol's ability to relieve stress depends on the nature (positive or negative) of stimuli in the drinker's immediate environment. Alcohol myopia theory might thus predict that alcohol's rewarding effects will be larger within familiar interactions and within secure relationships. In contrast, the social attributional theory of alcohol reinforcement predicts that alcohol-related reinforcement will be most pronounced within the context of unfamiliar social interactions.
 Study Population: Participants will consist of 600 male and female drinkers, aged 21-30, with no reported history of severe alcohol use disorder. Participants will be sampled such that at least 360 of these participants will classify as heavy drinkers.
 Design: In the laboratory arm of the study, individuals will be randomly assigned to consume either a moderate dose of alcohol or a control beverage in the company of either familiar or unfamiliar individuals. Of these individuals, a subset will also participate in an ambulatory assessment period over the course of several weeks to examine the interaction of alcohol and social contextual factors in daily life. In the ambulatory study arm, participants will wear transdermal sensors to assess BAC (calibrated for each individual within the laboratory session) and will further provide information about their mood and their social contexts in response to random prompts.
 Outcome Measures: Primary outcome measures include self-reports of positive and negative mood. The investigators will also examine facial expressions using the Facial Action Coding
 System, a comprehensive, anatomically-based system for categorizing facial muscle movement.
 One aim of the current study is to examine whether differential reinforcement from alcohol in unfamiliar social contexts emerges only with respect to self-reports, or is also observable within facial behaviors."

 While conventional hemodialysis (HD) modality effectively removes small-sized molecules, performance with middle-sized and protein-bound molecules is not well established. With increasing perception on importance of middle molecule removal, on-line hemodiafiltration (HDF) is getting more attention from healthcare professionals. However, HDF has not been widely used in Korea due to its technical burden and limited public funding issue.
 Novel medium cut-off (MCO) dialyzer, Theranova, is available in Korea, which showed superior performance on middle molecule removal to conventional HD and HDF from the previous study.
 This new dialyzer can be a good alternative option replacing conventional HD or even HDF with its benefits. However, current data available on the MCP dialyzer has certain limitations such as small sample size, no Asian subject included, limited types of biomarkers, and no clinical outcomes (particularly cardiovascular diseases) included.
 With this respect, performance comparison of MCO dialyzer with HDF in terms of clinical outcomes, including cardiovascular endpoint would fill the exiting data gap, which is absolutely important to make a clinical decision on dialysis modality."

 Current practice in patients with Clinical Stage I (CS I) testicular germ cell tumour is active surveillance after orchiectomy, with relapses occurring in 15-20% of patients. The majority of relapses occur in the lymph nodes as lymphogenic spread is the dominant route of dissemination. A sentinel node procedure, in which the sentinel lymph node is resected and pathologically examined, could be more reliable to identify patients who are likely to relapse.
 Early identification of patients with micro-metastases in the sentinel node makes it possible to treat these patients at the earliest possible moment. Absence of metastases could lead in the future to a less intensive follow up protocol than the present one."

 The study will recruit 15-20 young healthy Asian men of Chinese descent. Volunteers will visit Clinical Nutrition Research Centre (CNRC) on 5 occasions: once for consenting and screening procedures (visit 1) and four additional times, interspaced by a minimum of 2 days, to follow a 3 hour test session (Visit 2-5). The study aims to compare the effects of four different test meals , White bread, White bread , Rice-bran soymilk with white bread, Soymilk with white bread, on the glycaemic and insulinaemic response. Visit 1 (screening): For screening, potential subjects will come in the morning after an overnight fast. After obtaining informed consent, a series of screening tests will be conducted, including questionnaires (general health, physical activity and eating behaviour), anthropometry (height, weight, waist and hip circumference), blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, HbA1c and body composition by bioelectrical impedance analysis. Visits 2 to 5 (four experimental trials, in random order): Each of the four study visits will last for approximately 3 hours in the morning, during which the following will take place:During each test session, the subject arrives at the centre between 8:00 and 9:00 in the morning after an overnight fast and has been instructed to avoid any physical activity/exercise and alcohol on the day prior to the test. The session will start by placing an indwelling catheter into a vein in the forearm by trained personnel in a sterile environment. The catheter will be kept patent at all times and left on the forearm until the end of the session. Blood samples will then be taken from the cannula and from a finger prick to measure baseline levels of metabolites.
 Finger pricks will be done using disposable individual lancets which can cause minimal discomfort. After obtaining baseline blood samples, the subject will be given the test meal to consume within 15 minutes. Following the consumption of the test meal, blood samples (from the cannula and finger pricks) will be collected at periodic intervals (every 15 minutes for the first 90 minutes and every 30 minutes for the remaining 90 minutes). At each time point, a maximum of 5mL of blood will be drawn. In addition, at the same time points, finger prick blood samples will be taken for glucose analysis.

 Mechanical thrombectomy (MT), associated with standard IV thrombolysis (IVT) treatment, is effective during the acute phase of cerebral infarction with proximal occlusion of the anterior circulation in reducing disability at three months. MT-only treatment has only been assessed retrospectively in subgroups of controlled studies, with a significant difference in favour of the treatment. These results have led to a discussion about the benefits of MT without IVT in cases of proximal occlusion or carotid terminus occlusion. Recent data are in favour of a better prognosis for patients benefiting from a combined procedure. The impact of
 IVT on the implementation of MT is widely disputed, in particular the speed of execution, which could be enhanced by IVT. The factors influencing the time span and success of reperfusion after an MT are still not well-known, IVT in particular. The investigators have made the assumption that IVT could have an effect on the success of MT by shortening the duration of the procedure and increasing the likelihood of satisfactory revascularisation.
 The investigators carried out a retrospective study based on data gathered prospectively by the Franche-Comté Stroke Registry. The investigators also considered other factors which could have affected the duration of the procedure or the rate of satisfactory revascularisation, including location of infarct, thrombus size and stroke aetiology.
 Hypothesis: the investigators have made the assumption that IVT could have an effect on the success of MT by shortening the duration of the procedure and increasing the likelihood of satisfactory revascularisation."

 After given prior informed consent, volunteers will be classified and randomized using a website (randomization.com) by a non-involved researcher. At study beginning, volunteers will be evaluated through structured questionnaire. They will be submitted to the following evaluations: (i) Fugl-Meyer Scale; (ii) Motor Activity Log - 30; (iii) Functional independence measure; (iv) Patient Global Impression of Change Scale. tDCS - tDCS involves application of very low-amplitude direct currents (2 mA or less) via surface scalp electrodes. It produces a sub-sensory level of electrical stimulation wich remains imperceptible by most people during application. In a small percentage of patients, it may cause minimal discomfort with a mild tingling sensation, which usually disappears after a few seconds. Depending on the polarity, tDCS can increase or decrease corticomotor excitability. Anodal tDCS is able to facilitate neurons depolarization - increasing cortical excitability - while, on the other hand, cathodal tDCS hyperpolarizes the resting membrane potential, reducing the neuronal firing and the cortical excitabilityquestionnaire will be applied.
 Primary outcome measure Change in Fugl Meyer assesment of paretic upper limb motor function (time frame: baseline, before 6 session, after 10 sessions (10 days).
 Fugl Meyer assesment is used to measure motor control recovery. It is a 226 point scoring system that includes the following sessions: range of motion, pain, sensation,motor function of upper and lower limbs, balance, coordination and velocity. We will aplly only two sessions: upper limb motor function and coordination/velocity, these sessions totalize 66 points.
 Secondary outcome measures Cortical excitabilit level it will be evaluated through single pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation paradigms (Neurosoft, Russia). Initially, rest motor threshold (RMT) will be determined by finding the lowest stimulator output that elicit motor evoked potential (MEP) around 50 μV (TMS Motor Threshold Assessment Tool -MTAT 2.0 - USA).
 For RMT measure, a figure-eight coil connected to the magnetic stimulator held manually at 45 degrees from the midline, will be placed over the right primary motor cortex of lesioned and non lesioned hemisphere (C3 and/or C4 - 10/20 System). After, motor evoked potential will be evaluet by 20 pulses firing with 120% of RMT.
 Other pre specified outcome measures Change from Motor acitivy log - 30 (time frame: before and after 10 sessions (10 days)) MAL is a scripetd , structured, interview to measure real wordl upper extremity function. It was developed to measure the effects of therapy on the most impaired arm following stroke. Consists of 30 activities of daily living such as using a towel, brushing teath and picking up a glass. For a specificied time period post stroke, patients are asked about the extent of activity performance and how well it was performed by the most impaired arm. Response scale form o (never used) to 5 (same as pre stroke). Scores average for activity comprises the amount os use scale: the mean of scores of how well the acitivy was performed comprises the quality of movement. Ideaaly, ratings are obtained and as well as caregiver.
 Functional independence measure is a questionanere used to evaluate the functional ability of the patient after the disease. The scale contains 18 items, divided in two subscales: motor and cogntion. The evaluated activites included eating dressins, bathing, transfer and others.
 Each item ranges from 7 (complete independe) to 1 (total dependence), higher scores indicate more independece.
 EEG Patients will perform an assessment of brain activity through the EEG. Initially, patients will be placed seated in a chair at 90cm in front of a computer. Then, the equipment will be assembled, the points according to the 10-20 marking system will be identified: Cz,
 C3, C4, F3, F4, P3, P4, Fz and Pz.
 The protocol will follow the sequence of six consecutive moments (1 minute each) to monitor the patient's brain activity through Neuro Spectrum software: 1. 1st minute: REST: the patient will be relaxed, at rest, without any communication and with eyes open; 2. 2nd minute: OBSERVE - the patient will observe the video of the movement hand to mouth; 3. 3rd minute: EXECUTION - the patient will reproduce the movement of the video with healthy limb; 4. 4th minute: IMAGINATION - the patient will imagine the previous movement; 5. 5th minute: EXECUTION - the patient will reproduce the movement of the video with a paretic limb; 6. 6th minute: IMAGINATION - the patient will imagine the previous movement; Changes on

 Preclinical evidences suggest that reducing the concentration of blood metabolites and growth factors reduces the in vivo growth of several tumor models, while protecting normal tissues from the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapeutical treatments. In recent years, a plant-based, calorie-restricted, low-carbohydrate, low-protein diet, also known as Fasting Mimicking Diet (FMD), has been proposed as a potential anticancer dietary intervention. The FMD is safe when administered cyclically (every 21-28 days) to healthy volunteers, and is capable of significantly reducing the concentration of plasma glucose, serum insulin and IGF-1, while increasing levels of plasma IGFBPs and ketone bodies. The FMD has been shown to inhibit the in vivo growth of several tumor models, including breast cancer and melanoma mice models. The anticancer effects of the FMD are likely mediated by two concomitant mechanisms: 1) one direct anticancer effect that is mediated by the inhibition of energy production and anabolic pathways, such as protein and fatty acid synthesis, in cancer cells; 2) one indirect effect that is mediated by the activation of antitumor immunity, with the result of enhanced tumor infiltration by cytotoxic CD8+ T-lymphocytes and reduced infiltration by immunosuppressive populations. According to the currently accepted model, the anticancer and immunomodulatory effects of the FMD mostly derive from the reduction of circulating glucose, insulin and IGF-1 levels, and a parallel increase of ketone body and IGF-1 binding protein concentration.
 However, recent observations in healthy volunteers and cancer patients, suggest that
 FMD-mediated changes in many other metabolites, such as specific amino acids or fatty acids, could contribute to the cell-autonomous or immune-mediated anticancer effects of the FMD.
 While the study of the effects of the FMD in combination with standard treatments (e.g. chemotherapy, molecular targeted therapy) in advanced cancers represents the final objective of the ongoing studies, fully uncovering the metabolic and immunological effects of the FMD alone is essential to design future combination studies. From this perspective, the pre- and post-operative clinical settings in cancer patients who are not candidate to other medical treatments represent an ideal context to assess the effects of the FMD without other confounding factors. This trial primarily aims to assess the immunological and metabolic changes induced by the FMD in the pre-operative and post-operative setting in breast cancer and melanoma patients. Three cohorts of patients will be enrolled: 1) Cohort A: patients with resectable breast cancer (cT1N0M0 stage or cT1cN1M0-cT2cN0M0 stages not requiring pre-operative systemic treatment at the judgment of the investigator) who are candidate to curative surgery; 2) Cohort B: patients with malignant melanoma patients candidate to dissection of the lymph node basin because of a positive sentinel lymph node (stage
 IIIA-IIIB-IIIC); 3) Cohort C: patients with resected malignant melanoma (including radicalization and, in case, lymph node dissection) who are not candidate to any adjuvant treatment, but only to clinical and radiological follow-up (stage IIB-IIC). Patients in cohorts A and B will undergo one 5-days FMD cycle about 13-15 days before surgical removal of primary tumor (breast) or lymph nodes (breast, melanoma). Patients in cohort C will undergo 4 consecutive FMD cycles every 28 days, starting one month after surgery."

 Successful end-of-life communication between patients, caregivers, and physicians is associated with superior psychosocial outcomes, less intensive treatment, greater satisfaction, and higher likelihood of death at home. The Decision-Aid for Renal Therapy (DART) is an interactive web-based decision-aid that can empower patients and caregivers to select the treatment choice for chronic kidney disease that best suits them. DART was developed using a rigorous, validated, patient-engaged process and helps clarify decision-points and tradeoffs by providing individualized information about outcomes that matter most to patients. DART is designed to promote shared decision-making between patients, caregivers, and physicians and align preferences with treatment received.
 Although proven effective and in current use in the general population, DART's effectiveness in an older population is unclear. The purpose of this project is to conduct a pilot study of

 Evidence from controlled studies suggests that non-invasive physical therapies may help prevent headaches. Therapeutic ultrasound studies have generally been used in combination with other physical therapies.
 Therapeutic ultrasound is known to act in two different ways, thermal and non-thermal. With thermal effect, it is possible to reduce pain and joint joints and increase local blood flow, while stimulating tissue regeneration, soft tissue repair, blood flow regulation in chronic ischemic tissues and protein synthesis with nonthermal effect. In addition, its effect on inflammation accelerated repair by affecting cell activities, altering platelet membrane permeability, leading to the release of serotonin and accelerating wound healing.

 DES use has significantly improved clinical outcomes as compared with bare metal stents (BMS), primarily through a notable reduction in the risk of repeat revascularisation.
 However, durable polymer DES have been associated with an increased risk of late and very late stent thrombosis and the anticipated development of in-stent neoatherosclerosis. In addition, in-vivo study suggest that different types of polymer among current DES might have different responses to acute thrombogenecity after stent implantation.
 Patients with STEMI are associated with worse long-term clinical outcomes due to re-infarction and stent thrombosis throughout long-term follow-up. Underlying unstable lesion which includes ruptured plaque and thin-cap fibroatheroma behind stent strut is a predictor of neoatherosclerosis formation.
 There is no dedicated randomized trial to comparing biodegradable-polymer versus durable polymer-DES in terms of acute thrombogenecity and long-term healing at 3 years after primary
 PCI.
 Therefore this study is designed to compare the acute thrombogenecity and frequency of neoatherosclerotic lesions and other aspects of long term arterial healing at 3 years among patients treated with either a biodegradable polymer everolimus-eluting stent (Synergy) or a durable polymer everolimus-eluting stent (Xience Alpine) for STEMI."

 Primary dysmenorrhea is a very common problem for women. With a randomized, pragmatic study the investigators aim to evaluate whether a smartphone app for women with menstrual pain is effective in reducing menstrual pain in 18-34-year-old women with primary dysmenorrhea. For this the investigators compare the complete smartphone app with two control versions of this app. The complete app provides evidence-based self-care information and instructions for self-acupressure in menstrual pain, the control intervention I includes self-care information, but no instructions for self-acupressure, and control intervention II includes instructions for self-acupressure, but no self-care information. The investigators aim to observe 594 women with primary dysmenorrhea over 12 menstruation cycles. The primary outcome is the mean pain intensity on the days with pain during the 6th menstruation after randomization using a numerical rating scale (NRS; 0=no pain; 10=strongest pain imaginable).
 Women are eligible when they suffer from primary dysmenorrhea, are between 18 and 34 years old, not pregnant and do not plan to be pregnant within the next 12 months."

 The development of contemporary diabetes care offers new hope for long and satisfying lives of those with the disease, but also provides increased challenges for integration across the many dimensions of care (varied medications in addition to insulin, specialty services, diet, physical activity, stress management, etc.) and across the many who contribute to care (specialists, primary care providers, nurses, dietitians and patient educators, family members, friends, worksites). The Shanghai Integration Model (SIM) has made great strides to integrating specialty/hospital care with primary/community care. The addition of peer support can enhance patient engagement within that integrated care. Peer support can also integrate care with the daily behaviors and patterns that optimal diabetes management requires and with the family members and others in individuals' daily lives who can support diabetes management.
 The Insulin Peer Support project is a sub-project of Peer Support in Diabetes Care, with special focus on appropriate insulin use in the community, to help overcome barriers in insulin treatment and improve treatment compliance. This project will develop a peer support model for diabetes management in Chinese patients undergoing insulin treatment and evaluate its effectiveness in a randomized controlled trial of 10 CHCs in Shanghai.

 Background When it is severe, hypotension compromises tissue perfusion and organ function, leading to multiple organ failure and death. Commonly in intensive care units (ICUs), excessive vasodilation causes hypotension. In response, clinicians administer vasopressors to induce vasoconstriction and thereby raise blood pressure. However, these medications may reduce blood flow to vital organs, including the heart, and therefore damage them. Titrating vasopressors therefore requires balancing the risks of organ dysfunction arising from vasopressors or hypotension. Current guidelines recommend titrating vasopressors to a mean arterial pressure (MAP) 65 mmHg. By not specifying an upper limit, guidelines and clinicians put more emphasis on preventing hypotension than on minimizing vasopressor exposure.
 Permissive hypotension, defined as a MAP target below traditional levels, may reduce vasopressor-induced harm while avoiding organ dysfunction induced by severe hypotension.
 Work by the investigators group Observational data from the investigators group show that the average MAP in Canadian patients on vasopressors is 75 mmHg, 10 mmHg above current guideline recommendations and self-reported practices.The recent CIHR-funded OVATION pilot RCT (n=118) of permissive hypotension met feasibility objectives of demonstrating a separation in mean
 MAP between arms (9 mmHg, p<0.0001) and enrolling patients efficiently (2.3 patients/site/month). Investigators have also completed an individual patient data meta-analysis with the French SEPSISPAM trial and found that a lower MAP target may be beneficial in patients 65 years old.
 Objective The OVATION-65 RCT will evaluate the effect of permissive hypotension vs. usual care in patients 65 years old with vasodilatory hypotension treated with vasopressors for ≤12 hours on the co-primary outcomes of myocardial injury (high sensitivity cardiac troponin
 [cTn], a validated marker of myocardial injury and powerful prognostic factor in ICU patients) and 90-day mortality. Secondary outcomes will include other end-organ biomarkers.
 Investigators hypothesize that permissive hypotension will reduce organ injury and death.
 Methods Eligible patients will be randomized to target MAP 60-65 mmHg vs. usual care.
 Investigators selected usual care to avoid protocol misalignment with standard practices and after ascertaining contemporary vasopressor use in Canada, which suggests that the risk of contamination is low. Investigators will enroll 200 patients in 5 Canadian ICUs. The deferred consent model will be adopted, successfully used in the pilot trial. Risk of bias will be minimized by allocation concealment, blinding of outcome assessors, complete hospital follow-up and intention-to-treat analysis.
 Relevance This RCT proposal is embedded in the international OVATION65 program of research, which includes the ongoing NIHR-funded UK65 Trial, designed by the investigators group, which measures 90-day mortality as the primary outcome. The pooled analysis of both RCTs will be powered to detect a plausible difference of 6% in mortality. The proposed Canadian OVATION65
 RCT will be the only trial that measures organ injury biomarkers, providing crucial clinical information regardless of the effect on mortality. Results will be incorporated into guidelines to inform practice worldwide."

 The mirror neuron system (MNS) broadly refers to a network of brain regions that responds both when a person performs an action and when that person observes someone else performing the same action. This system emerges in infancy and develops over time to support more complex social abilities. It has been hypothesized that autism involves fundamental impairments to the MNS, which can explain the deficits in joint attention, imitation, communication and social cognition.
 This study investigates the MNS in 100 toddlers and preschoolers recently diagnosed with autism or with a suspected diagnosis of autism. First, children with (suspected) autism complete a battery of behavioral measures and MNS activity will be assessed using electrophysiology (EEG; event-related potentials) while the child participates in specific tasks. Then, the children with (suspected) autism will be randomly assigned to one of two behavioral intervention programs (i.e., targeted joint attention intervention or parent education intervention) that will be carried out by interventionists and parents for 10-12 weeks. At the end of the intervention, these children will be re-evaluated on behavioral tasks and EEG to investigate changes as a result of the intervention.
 The investigators hypothesize that the joint attention intervention will lead to significant changes on both the neural and behavioral measures of MNS functioning."

 Vibration Analgesia in Propofol Infusion During Anesthesia Induction
 Nash, D & Pothula, A
 Background and Significance
 Infusion of propofol during the process of inducing anesthesia can cause a fair amount of transient discomfort to patients while the are on the operating table and of intact faculties. It is not uncommon for patients to cry out in pain. The investigators have noticed this first hand on numerous occasions and have wondered if there is a risk-free way to lesson the pain associated with propofol infusion.
 This study will focus on the use of vibration analgesia to potentially reduce the pain associated with propofol infusion. Vibration is proposed to stimulate A-beta nerve fibers, which transmit information from vibration and touch which, according to the Gate Control
 Theory of Pain (Melzack and Wall 1965), inhibits signal transduction by A-delta and C fibers (Kakigi and Shibasaki 1992). Vibration has been demonstrated to be effective to decrease pain during vaccinations, phlebotomy, and dental anesthesia (Baxter et al. 2011; Nanitsos et al. 2009).
 In this study, the investigators seek to evaluate the role of vibration in the reduction of discomfort associated with painful stimulus associated with anesthesia induction. Through this study, the investigators hope to develop a comprehensive and cost-effective approach to minimize patient discomfort during anesthesia induction.
 Study Design
 The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of vibration as a analgesic during induction of anesthesia. It is the investigators hypothesis that both vibration will lessen the pain of propofol infusion.
 Patients sets to receive a propofol infusion as part of induction of anesthesia during surgery will be recruited to participate in this study. All participating patients will be randomized following acquisition of consent for study participation to one of two intervention groups: 1) normal standard of care infusion of propofol without analgesia 2) infusion of propofol with application of vibration analgesia. Patients will then be asked to place a mark on a 100-mm visual analogue scale corresponding to the level of pain that they experienced during the digital block. Additionally, Please see the next section for specific details regarding the intervention.
 Due to constraints regarding the validity of the linear visual analogue scale in very young patients (Stinson et al. 2006), only those aged 8 years or older will be eligible for participation in the study. Parents or guardians will provide consent for minors or for individuals who are otherwise unable to provide consent themselves.
 Exclusion criteria include The primary outcome will be the level of pain reported by the patient following propofol injection, with or without an vibration analgesia adjunct.
 Secondary outcomes will include subgroup analysis for responses in pain as stratified by pathology, age, sex, and ethnicity.
 Intervention
 Patients will be randomized to one of two treatment groups (as described above).
 The intervention group will receive vibration only, with application of the BUZZY device just proximal to the intravenous infusion site immediately before and during propofol infusion.
 Randomization will be performed by placing equal numbers of indicators for each treatment group in opaque, sealed envelopes, which will be shuffled. The surgeon will have access to a kit which contains these envelopes. One card will be selected in sequence from the pre-shuffled stack for each patient who gives consent to participate in the study.
 Following intervention, patients will be asked to rate the discomfort of the procedure on both a Numeric Rating Scale, with a number between 0 and 10, and a Visual Analogue Scale, by placing a mark on a continuous 10 cm line corresponding to their level of perceived pain.
 These values will be used to compare efficacy between each intervention arm as described in the Statistics section.
 With regards to safety outcomes, no significant safety issues are anticipated beyond those inherent to established practice.
 Response cards will not contain any identifiable patient information, and will be linked to consent forms only through a numerical key. Consent forms will be stored separately in a secure in-hospital location following each patient interaction.
 Intervention will be performed in the operating room during anesthesia induction, as indicated, following acquisition of patient consent and randomization to a treatment arm as described above. Only a single intervention will be performed. Routine office follow-up will be offered to each patient for longitudinal management of any potential harms experienced from digital block.
 Population
 Patients will be recruited from Montefiore Medical Center, Hutchinson ambulatory surgery center in the preoperative holding area prior to their surgery.
 The study sample size will need to be approximately 200 patients, 100 in each treatment arm, to achieve a power of 80% to detect a difference of 10 mm on the Visual Analogue Scale between any two study arms. This was based upon a previous study (Nakayama et al. 2001) which demonstrated a mean reduction in discomfort between buffered and unbuffered lidocaine of 1.0 on the Numeric Rating Scale (from 3.5 to 2.5, with a SD of 1.4).
 Given that the study involves a single interaction, there is no dropping out from the study or loss-to-follow-up anticipated.
 Inclusion and exclusion criteria are described in the previous section. Specifically, however, children younger than 8 years may not be recruited into the study, as the Visual
 Analogue Scale is not considered reliable for that age group (please see Study Design section). Additionally, patients for whom no consent may be obtained from the patient, parent/guardian, or surrogate, will not be eligible for the study.
 The consent form will be provided in English, and will be reviewed via translation phone for non-English-speakers, provided that the treating or examining physician is not fluent in the patient's preferred language.
 No tissue specimens or blood samples will be obtained from participating patients.
 Recruitment
 Patients will be recruited into the study by the surgeon prior to their operation. No additional recruitment materials will planned. The study will be explained in-person and consent obtained with appropriate documentation. Privacy will be protected by keeping the consent documentation in a separate, locked, secure location from the response cards.
 Informed Consent
 The informed consent form in use for this study is based upon the Einstein IRB recommended template and has been included with this study application.
 Informed consent will be obtained in the preoperative holding area where the patient is spoken to by both the anesthesiologist and surgeon. Eligible patients will be given the opportunity to enroll in the study after it has been determined that they will receive propofol infusion as part of their anesthesia..
 If they prefer to forgo study participation, they will receive the Standard Treatment and will not be enrolled; no information from the encounter, excepting a running count of individuals who refused to participate, will be recorded for use in the study. There is no requirement for a waiver of informed consent.
 In the case of unemancipated minors over the age of 7, the informed consent discussion will be held with the legal parent or guardian of the child, as self-identified, with verbal confirmation by the examiner, with the same assurances as above. If a parent or legal guardian is unavailable, the child/adolescent will not be enrolled into the study. Verbal assent from the minor will be obtained prior to enrollment in the study.
 This study will be performed without additional cost to participating patients and no renumeration will be offered for participation.
 All enrolling physicians will be employees of Montefiore Medical Center or the New York City
 Health and Hospitals Corporation and will have received training in accordance to the Health
 Information Portability and Accountability Act.
 Risks/Benefits
 Risks associated with the BUZZY(tm) device There are no known risks for the use of the
 BUZZY(tm) device, which is registered as an FDA class III device (therapeutic massager).
 Risks to privacy The only identifiable patient information in this study will be the consent form, which will be linked to the corresponding response for by a numerical key. The consent forms will be collected daily and placed in a separate, secure location. No component of this study will be videotaped for research purposes.
 Benefits Patients who agree to participate in this study will be given the chance to have an opportunity to receive an analgesic modality (vibration) to reduce the pain of local anesthetic injection. This is expected to reduce the discomfort of propofol infusion.
 This study will benefit general practice by helping reduce pain with propofol infusions and become the new standard of care for its administration. There is a non-negligible cost associated with its use.
 Statistical Methods All data will be entered into a single SPSS database. ANOVA will be performed to determine if significant differences are present between study groups in terms of demographic/injury characteristics and the primary outcome. Univariate analysis will be performed on the demographic and injury characteristic to determine if any of them have a significant effect on the primary outcome. If any individual characteristic is found to have a significant effect, multiple linear regression will be performed to control for potential confounders.
 As no intervention in this study entails significant risk above that entailed by the standard-of-care, there is no plan for interim analysis or early termination of the study.
 Since this investigation involves only a single patient interaction, there are no anticipated issues regarding loss-to-follow-up.
 Data Quality Control The primary data points for this study are the Visual Analogue Scale and
 Numerical Rating Scale of pain, as reported by patients immediately following digital block.
 The NRS, although not necessarily as reliable as the VAS, is a single whole number, which cannot be subject to interpretation by the examiner. The VAS is measured from a value of 0-10cm along a continuous line, and the patient is asked to place a mark on the line at a point at which, they feel, corresponds to the level of their pain. This value will be measured by a third,independent investigator not otherwise involved in the study.
 Following acquisition of the NRS and VAS pain values, these values will be entered in the study database, which will be maintained solely by the primary investigators, keyed to individual participants' consent forms by a non-identifying serial number. Again, the consent forms will be stored in a separate location.
 All statistical analyses will be reviewed and verified with a faculty statistician.

 The optimal approach to fluid balance in critically ill patients is uncertain. A recent systematic review found low quality evidence in favour of a conservative fluid or deresuscitative approach (active removal of accumulated fluid using diuretics and/or renal replacement therapy) compared with a liberal strategy or usual care. The RADAR-2 pilot randomised trial will compare conservative fluid and deresuscitation with usual care in patients who are mechanically ventilated in an intensive care unit. The main hypothesis is that in critically ill patients, a post-resuscitation fluid strategy comprising conservative fluid administration and active deresuscitation reduces net fluid balance, is safe and improves clinical outcomes."

 It is now understood that the nervous system has remarkable adaptive capacity. Specifically, the central nervous system retains its ability to reorganize in structure and function in response to behavioral experience in neurologically intact people and in individuals with neurological injury. Cognitive and motor learning guide the adaptation of the central nervous system and are essential components of effective training paradigms.
 There is a growing body of literature which suggests that inducing a transient state of systemic ischemia has the potential to induce spinal plasticity, strengthen spared pathways to motorneurons, and lead to improved motor recovery following neurological injury.1,2
 Specifically, daily systemic ischemic conditioning has been shown to improve both forelimb and respiratory motor function in rodent models of chronic cervical spinal injury.1,3
 Moreover, systemic ischemic conditioning resulted in increased ankle strength (single session)2 and augmented walking speed and endurance (5 sessions)4 in humans with motor incomplete spinal cord injuries.
 In a related area of research, it has been shown that ischemic conditioning administered peripherally represents a strategy for harnessing the body's endogenous protective capabilities against lethal levels of ischemia. With this technique, applying brief ischemia and reperfusion to a remote organ or tissue results in significantly reduced damage from subsequent exposures to ischemia. For example, applying a tourniquet and creating hypoxia in a rat's hindlimb for 10 minutes reduced the extent of cardiac abnormalities following a sustained ischemic insult.5 This same phenomenon has been shown in humans. Applying an inflated blood pressure cuff to the upper or lower limb has shown efficacy for protection in people undergoing cardiac surgeries,6,7 undergoing elective surgery to repair abdominal aortic aneurysm,8 experiencing MI,9 and with symptomatic intracranial arterial stenosis.7
 The mechanisms underlying the neuroplastic and neuroprotective effects of ischemic conditioning are not fully understood. At this time, the literature indicates that there are both humoral and neural mechanisms responsible for the protection and the plasticity. It is clear that ischemic conditioning results in widespread physiological effects and that the observed effects work through multiple mechanistic pathways.
 The next translational step is to investigate whether combining ischemic conditioning with behavioral training has the ability to augment motor learning. Specifically, we will employ remote limb ischemic conditioning (via inflation/deflation of a blood pressure cuff) with the objective of activating the endogenous pathways shown to elicit neuroplasticity. If eventually effective, RLIC could have profound effect on the rehabilitation and recovery of motor function in people with stroke. It is important to first start this translational investigation in neurologically intact people in order to determine optimal protocols for people with stroke.
 The purpose of this study is to test the effect of number of RLIC cycles on motor learning in neurologically intact adults and if we can find a physiological blood marker related to effective administration of RLIC. We hypothesize that 3 cycles of RLIC will be sufficient to enhance motor leaning compared to sham conditioning, and that there will be a dose-dependent (number of cycles) response in learning, thus making training more efficient, more effective, and longer-lasting. Determining the number of cycles necessary to elicit the benefits of RLIC is important in developing the most effective and least burdensome treatment for future patients with motor deficits."

 The goal of the proposed study is to perform a randomized, controlled trial (RCT) to test the efficacy of a novel integrative exercise program called Preventing Loss of Independence through Exercise (PLIE) on function and quality of life in older adults living in the community with Mild cognitive impairment (MCI), which is an intermediate stage between the expected cognitive decline of normal aging and the more-serious decline of dementia.
 Because current dementia medications have minimal impact on function and quality of life and do not stop or slow the disease course, it would be desirable if there were an intervention that could prevent or delay the onset of full-blown dementia. Moreover, there is growing evidence that behavioral interventions such as exercise have a variety of beneficial effects in individuals with dementia and MCI.
 PLIE was developed based on recent discoveries in neuroscience and experimental psychology that have found that, although explicit memory (the ability to consciously recall new information) is impaired in individuals with dementia, implicit memory (unconscious learning that typically occurs through repeated exposure) is relatively preserved. Therefore, PLIE focuses on training procedural memory (unconscious learning of procedures) to build the strength and capacity to perform the movements that are most needed for daily function (e.g., transitioning safely from sitting to standing). In addition, to maximize the benefits of the training, PLIE integrates elements of Eastern and Western exercise modalities to develop mindful body awareness and enhance social connection.
 The investigators have completed a pilot study of the PLIE program at an adult day center in
 San Francisco, CA. Results suggest that PLIE was associated with clinically meaningful improvements in cognitive function, physical performance and quality of life as well as reduced caregiver burden when compared with usual care at the facility. The current study will enable the investigators to build on this pilot study results by performing a RCT of
 PLIE for individuals who have MCI but who do not yet have dementia.
 Study participants will be randomly assigned to receive the PLIE intervention program (1 hour, 2 days/week, 4 months) or Usual Care (UC) control (standard senior center activities, 1 hour, 2 days/week, 4 months) (N=40, 20/group) using a wait-list design. The co-primary outcomes are 4-month change in physical function (Short Physical Performance Battery, SPPB), cognitive function (Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - cognitive subscale, ADAS-cog) and quality of life (Quality of Life in Alzheimer's Disease, QOL-AD). The investigators will also look at the 4-month change in the following neuroimaging measures: brain volume with structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), functional connectivity with resting-state functional MRI, cerebral perfusion with arterial-spin labeled MRI. To account for the wait-list design, all outcomes will be assessed at baseline, 4 months and 8 months.
 The proposed project will address a critically important health problem related to optimizing functional status and quality of life in older individuals with MCI. The current study will utilize rigorous research methods to test the efficacy of an innovative and promising new program for older adults with MCI. If the program is successful, the investigators will work with VA and community-based organizations to implement PLIE more broadly."

 Ultrasound debridement is a method of removing devitalized tissue through microstreaming and cavitational effects. The non-thermal energy up-regulates cell activity and promotes growth factor and protein synthesis, fibrinolysis, and is anti-bacterial. The technology selectively emulsifies dead and dying tissues with micro-sized gas bubbles, stimulates membranes of surrounding healthy cells, and render bacteria more susceptible to antibiotic treatment.
 Thus, in addition to creating an optimal environment, the modality also serves to promote the process of healing. At St. Michael's Hospital, ultrasound debridement is already being used in the wound clinic with promising results. However, objective comparisons need to be made to quantify and qualify our clinical observations. The goal of the proposed pilot study is to assess feasibility of our current study design and allow us to refine the research methodology for the development of a larger-scale study."

 Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is the most common surgical procedure aimed against ischemic heart disease (IHD) in Sweden. Early and late success of CABG is the result of sustained patency of the bypass grafts. The choice of conduit (graft) for CABG has been shown to impact graft patency. The excellent early and late patency of in situ left internal thoracic artery (LITA) has stimulated the use of other arterial grafts, such as the radial artery (RA) and the right internal thoracic artery (RITA). However, target coronary vessels/lesions are limitations for the use of RITA and RA, and concerns regarding postoperative sternal wound infection with increases of early morbidity and mortality are reasons for limited use of bilateral ITA. The saphenous vein grafts (SVG), together with the left internal thoracic artery, are still the most commonly used conduits in CABG surgery.
 Vein graft failure is associated with recurrence of angina and one of the primary reasons for reintervention, either by redo CABG or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Early vein graft failure is not uncommon, and it was shown in the PREVENT IV multi-center trial6, that vein graft failure (occluded or stenosed) had occurred in 27% of all vein grafts at one year.
 Despite this, SVG remains as an important conduit for most patients in contemporary bypass surgery and every effort should focus on promoting short and long-term patency of SVG.
 Previous studies by Souza have demonstrated that harvesting the SVG with a pedicle of surrounding tissue and without vein graft distension, the so-called No touch technique (NT), significantly improve patency compared with conventional technique i.e. stripping the vein of all adventitial tissue and distension prior to implantation. An international multi center randomized controlled clinical trial, (SUPERIOR SVG, NCT01047449) including 12 centers and 250 patients, was recently presented and showed favorable but not significant results for
 No touch vein grafts compared to conventional vein grafts. The protocol did not include cardiac computed tomography angiography (CCTA) for every patient which is an important difference compared to our planned study.
 The major limitation regarding the putative benefit of NT technique of vein harvesting is that most of the data has all been derived from a single center. The surgical vein graft harvesting technique for NT grafts is more demanding. Therefore, there is a clear clinical equipoise to perform a multi-center randomized clinical trial to validate the excellent single-center results and determine whether the NT technique is reproducible, feasible and generalizable."

 Men with erectile dysfunction, unresponsive to conservative therapies, are recommended to undergo placement of an inflatable penile prosthesis (IPP); however, it is a common complaint post-operatively that their penis length is shorter than what it was previously.
 Several attempts have been made by investigators to optimize penile length prior to placement of the penile prosthesis. Compared to other options, penile traction therapy (PTT) offers several potential advantages in that it is minimally-invasive, does not increase the morbidity of surgery, and has not been shown to result in any long-term side effects.
 A new penile traction device (RestoreX® ) was created and funded through Mayo Ventures. Given the clinical issue of dissatisfaction with penile length post IPP, the potential role for
 PTT, and limited amount of data available, we sought to perform a clinical trial evaluating the effect of PTT on increasing the total length of prosthesis which can be inserted. We additionally sought to determine if PTT resulted in improved post-operative satisfaction on total penile length achieved.
 To accomplish the study, a population of men from Mayo Clinic planning to undergo placement of an IPP will be enrolled and will be randomized to either the control (no treatment) group or PTT for 3 months prior to their procedure. Outcomes will be assessed prior to surgery and 3, 6, and 12 months post-procedure. Results are to be used with the intent to publish in a scientific journal."

 This trial proposes a therapy for pediatric Hodgkin lymphoma with the objective of achieving high levels of long lasting complete remission with less risk of late effects.
 Patients of both genders, between 2 and 18 years, with newly diagnosed classical Hodgkin lymphoma are admitted. An open surgical biopsy with histopatological diagnosis is preferred.
 Initial staging provides stratification in three groups: low, intermediate and high risk. An initial set of two chemotherapy courses is administered to all cases after which an early disease response assessment is performed. According to disease response a final therapy group is assigned (7 arms).
 Imaging with PET-CT and Deauville Score is preferred for initial and further disease assessment. Complete response is defined by volume reduction and metabolic remission. In case
 PET-CT is not available, CT and ultrasound with volume reduction standards to assess response may be used.
 Rapid early responders who achieve complete remission (CR) benefit from less chemotherapy.
 Those who are in partial remission at the end of chemotherapy (late disease assessment) receive low dose (30Gy) involved node radiotherapy. At the end of chemotherapy, radiotherapy is delivered only to patients who do not achieve a CR. Thus, therapy is tailored according to initial extension and disease responsiveness. Complete responders at the end of chemotherapy do not receive radiotherapy. To avoid radiotherapy in the majority of cases constitutes a principal goal of this trial. Stable or progressive disease at any moment is assumed as a trial failure and new therapeutic strategies are offered to these patients off protocol.
 Chemotherapy is based upon regimes with well known effectiveness in Hodgkin lymphoma. (i.e.
 ABVD: doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine and dacarbazine and ESHAP: Etoposide, methyl prednisolone, citarabine and cisplatin).
 Low risk arms (Arms A, B and B2) receive no more than 4 cycles of ABVD. Intermediate risk Arm
 C, 5 cycles of ABVD and Arm D 4 cycles of ABVD and 2 courses of ESHAP. High risk Arm E receives 3 cycles of ABVD and 3 Cycles of ESHAP, Arm F receives 4 courses of ABVD and 4 courses of ESHAP. The schedules are delivered projecting low cumulative drug doses and avoiding the use of toxic alkylating agents. Risks of secondary leukemia and infertility are thus minimized. Doxorubicin and bleomycin do not achieve cumulative doses that may expose to significant risk of heart or lung damage. Radiotherapy reduction avoids late radiation sequels.
 Cardiac, lung , thyroid and any other toxic effects are prospectively assessed at onset and regularly during and after therapy.
 The main event-free and overall survival proportions end points will be analyzed annually during the following 10 years after the last patient registration.
 This clinical study proposes a therapeutic approach based on chemotherapy that do not sum up high cumulative toxic doses. Therapy is tailored according to initial risk assessment and disease responsiveness. Those who achieve a complete response after chemotherapy do not receive additional radiotherapy, thus avoiding further late effects."

 Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer and the third highest cause of mortality in Vietnamese and Asian Americans. CRC incidence is rising rapidly in
 Vietnamese Americans, but they have among the lowest rates of CRC screening (14%) and are more likely to be diagnosed with advanced stage disease, which is highly preventable. Over 85% of Vietnamese Americans in our region (PA, NJ, and NYC) are foreign-born with limited
 English proficiency, have low SES, and live in economically disadvantaged neighborhoods. Many lack knowledge about CRC risks and screening benefits and have limited access to culturally appropriate preventive care. Thus, a multilevel intervention is needed to address the multiple barriers to and determinants of CRC screening in this community. Vietnamese community organizations (VCOs) serve dynamic social functions and represent an important resource for addressing this critical health disparity priority by promoting CRC screening.
 This project builds on established partnerships and successful work of Center for Asian
 Health, Temple University with Vietnamese CBOs that address their overwhelming health disparities. CBPR principles will be applied to engage 20 VCOs in all phases of planning, implementing, evaluating, and disseminating a culturally appropriate, theory- and evidence-based multilevel CRC intervention. The proposed intervention will be guided by
 Social Ecological Model, which addresses sociocultural, behavioral and environmental determinants and intervention strategies at the individual, interpersonal, and community organizational levels. CDC's Clinical Preventive Services Guidelines for adults 50+ (CPS) recommend that cancer screenings and other preventive services should be promoted. The standard CPS will be provided to both intervention and control groups, and intervention group will receive CPS + multilevel CRC intervention. Specific Aim 1 is to test the hypothesis that
 CPS + multilevel CRC intervention will yield higher CRC screening rates compared to CPS control at 12-month follow up; Aim 2 is to examine whether CPS + multilevel CRC intervention (which includes CHW-led group education, automated and interactive text messaging and phone-based peer support) is more effective in changing screening determinants (e.g. KAB, self-efficacy, risk factors, lifestyles, social support, social norms, access barriers) than
 CPS control condition; and Aim 3 is to assess costs and cost-effectiveness of CPS + multilevel CRC intervention compared to CPS control condition in relation to CRC screening rates in order to inform future dissemination efforts. In sum, this project represents the first large-scale community-based randomized controlled trial of a multilevel, culturally-appropriate CBPR intervention to increase CRC screening among underserved
 Vietnamese. If effective, this innovative multilevel CRC intervention can be used as a model program that has potential generalizability and sustainability in Asian American and other underserved ethnic communities to impact preventive behaviors at the population level."

 The prevalence of bacteria resistant to antibiotics is increasing and there is a correlation between high consumption of antibiotics and high incidence of antibiotic resistance. It is therefore important to reduce the prescription of antibiotics. Antibiotics in dental care are used to treat oral infections as well as to prevent infections associated with surgical procedures. An example of the latter is antibiotic prophylaxis associated with dental implant surgery in order to reduce the risk of postoperative infection that can lead to loss of implant.The study will be conducted as a multicenter placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial. Eligible patients will be asked for participation and those who leave oral and written information will be included in the study. Patients included will be allocated to either active treatment (antibiotic prophylaxis) or placebo. Both clinicians and patients will be blinded to group affiliation. A total of 10 clinicians in 8 centers in the south of Sweden have agreed to participate and each clinicians will be allowed to use the implants and routines that they usually work with.
 Specific aims of the study are to test the following hypotheses: 1. There is no difference in proportion of patients with early implant losses in patients receiving 2 g of amoxicillin preoperatively and patients receiving identical placebo tablets. 2. There is no difference in proportion of patients with early infections between patients receiving 2 g of amoxicillin preoperatively and patients receiving identical placebo tablets. 3. There is no difference in early marginal bone loss (within 12 months postoperatively) between patients receiving 2 g of amoxicillin preoperatively and patients receiving identical placebo tablets.
 If it appears that antibiotic prophylaxis does not lead to any risk reduction, this result may provide a basis for guidelines rejecting antibiotic prophylaxis in dental implant surgery."

 Communication is an essential aspect of life for all individuals including children with autism. Many children with autism are severely impaired in their verbal communication development and there is a need for additional research demonstrating the effectiveness of interventions that improve communication for participants with autism and severe communication impairments. The proposed study directly follows from a recently published pilot study demonstrating both the feasibility and importance of an intervention designed for children with autism and minimal verbal skills (less than 20 words pre-intervention) (Brady et al., 2015). The project will follow up this pilot study with a two stage SMART (Sequential
 Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial) design that will allow comparison of results from an experimental intervention to a treatment as usual condition, and compare two intensities of multimodal intervention. Further, the project will investigate how proposed variables measured at the outset of intervention predict responsiveness to the treatment conditions.
 Aim 1. Investigate the effectiveness of a multimodal intervention aimed at teaching students with autism and minimal verbal skills to produce new words with speech and augmentative communication (AAC). Briefly, the multimodal approach combines joint book reading, computerized instruction, and AAC. The AAC component teaches participants to select target words on speech generating devices in communication routines. All components will focus on teaching a set of vocabulary selected for each participant based on results from digitized recordings of sounds produced over a 12-hour time period. Target vocabulary will be one-syllable words that consist of sounds in each child's phonetic repertoire in sequences that are highly represented in the English language (i.e., high phonotactic probability) and determine if increasing intensity leads to better outcomes for participants who do not respond to the initial intervention. Increased intensity or regular multimodal intervention may be better for those who do not respond to treatment as usual. Primary outcome measures include:
 -  Total number of words each child learns to say and the number of words each child learns to produce with AAC during intervention.
 -  Total number of words each child says in generalization contexts. Generalization of word use to classrooms and at home will be measured with recordings from generalization probes conducted in homes and classrooms.
 Aim 2. Investigate potential predictor variables for individual differences in learning outcomes measured in Aim 1. Results from Brady et al. (2015) showed 5 of 10 participants were high responders to multi-modal intervention - learning 18 or more new words over approximately 2 months of intervention. However, three participants learned to say only a few words and two participants essentially made no progress. The project will examine individual predictors of differential responding and identify variables that will enable clinicians to personalize intervention according to specific environmental and participant characteristics.
 The proposed predictor variables are:
 -  Environmental variables: Based on previous research linking the amount and type of environmental input to children's word acquisition, vocabulary input from parents and teachers will be measured with automated speech recognition technology. Existing technology available through LENA™ software (Warren et al., 2010) will be used to measure total number of words produced by communicative partners and conversational turns in home and school environments.
 -  Participant characteristics: Based on the pilot investigation as well as previous longitudinal studies, the following specific child variables are proposed to be predictive of responsiveness to one of the experimental interventions: verbal imitation, receptive vocabulary, adaptive behavior, autism severity, and nonverbal communication complexity measured with the Communication Complexity Scale (CCS; Brady et al., 2012).
 Results will drive the development of more effective adaptive language interventions for minimally verbal children with autism and related intellectual and developmental disabilities."

 The major barrier to a cure for HIV infection is the persistence of latently infected CD4+ T cells on antiretroviral therapy (ART). HIV is concentrated in vivo in Th17 cells in blood and the gastrointestinal tract. Th17 cells are critical mediators of mucosal immunity against bacteria and fungi and are rapidly depleted in the gut following HIV acquisition with subsequent gut epithelial permeability, microbial translocation and ensuing chronic inflammation which is not completely reversed on ART. Such inflammation may contribute to HIV persistence by potentiating T cell proliferation and thereby clonal expansion of infected cells, by exacerbating CD8+ T cell exhaustion and potentially by promoting viral replication despite ART.
 Vitamin D has pleiotropic effects on the immune system including directing naïve CD4+ T cells away from the Th17 phenotype toward an anti-inflammatory regulatory T cell phenotype. It may also have beneficial effects on dendritic cell and CD8+ T cell immunity. Furthermore, vitamin
 D has been shown in animal models to strengthen gut epithelial integrity and in healthy volunteers to promote a more diverse gut microbiome.
 The investigators plan to perform a pilot randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial of high dose vitamin D supplementation in HIV-infected participants on suppressive ART and to determine its effect on immune activation, Th17 cell frequency, gut barrier integrity, the gut microbiome and HIV persistence."

 Individuals: 11,800 Individuals with repeated samples: 3,500 Sampling occasions: 15,300
 This registration will only cover blood sampling (screenings since 1990) and dietary data (optional MONICA study, screenings since 1986) as a part of the National Environmental
 Biobank. The participation rates have been 69-81%.
 A separate registration is expected for the basic MONICA study."

 Numerous factors predispose women to develop pregnancy-related complications, these include gestational diabetes (GDM), pre-pregnancy obesity, advanced maternal age (> 35 years) and gestational age, abnormal weight gain during pregnancy, family history of diabetes, PCOS and low parity. Evidenced-based studies reported that women with PCOS have a significantly higher risk of developing GDM compared with women without PCOS, independently of the obesity factor; this risk is higher when both factors coexist.
 Given the known effect of reproductive hormones on weight-gain, controversies still exist on whether ART predispose women to more adverse obstetric outcomes compared to normal pregnancy.
 ART describes different procedures to help women become pregnant, with In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) being the most commonly performed. It has been demonstrated that IVF is associated with glucose intolerance in mice and it will be interesting to determine whether this physiologic phenomenon is also altered by IVF medication (such as estrogen and progesterone) in humans.
 While some studies reported that singleton pregnancies conceived by ART (IVF or ovulation induction) were strongly associated with GDM compared to spontaneous conceptions, other studies did not find significant differences in the risk of GDM. Increased GDM risk presented with IVF can be associated with prenatal obesity or secondary to maternal PCOS condition. The former studies did not specify the body mass index (BMI) and the medical history of participants undergoing IVF, such as the presence of PCOS. Due to limited available data, we still cannot distinguish whether these adverse pregnancy outcomes are due to the pre-existing conditions such as PCOS, or are secondary to the IVF therapy itself."

 CTL Administration:
 If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive the CTLs by vein (also called an infusion) over about 30 minutes. You will stay in the clinic for about 1 hour after the CTL infusion so that you can be checked for any side effects you may have.
 You will be given standard drugs to help decrease the risk of side effects. You may ask the study staff for information about how the drugs are given and their risks.
 If your doctor thinks it is needed, you may receive additional CTL infusions.
 Length of Study:
 You will take part in this study for 12 months after your final CTL infusion. Your participation on this study will be over when you have completed the 12-month visit.
 You will no longer be able to receive the CTL infusion(s) if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, if you need medical treatment not allowed in this study, or if you are unable to follow study directions.
 Study Visits:
 Since you may have more than one CTL infusion, the study visit time points are based on the time of your last CTL infusion.
 Within 72 hours before each CTL infusion:
 -  You will have a physical exam.
 -  Blood (about 7 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine testing, to test for adenovirus, and for genetic testing.
 -  Urine will be collected for routine tests.
 -  You will have a chest x-ray.
 One (1) time each during Weeks 1-4, and then at 45 days and about 3, 6, and 12 months after each CTL infusion:
 -  You will have a physical exam.
 -  You will have standard of care tests to check the status of graft versus host disease (GVHD - a condition in which transplanted tissue attacks the body into which it is transplanted).
 -  Blood (about 8 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine testing, to check for adenovirus, and to test the effect of the CTLs on adenovirus and your immune system, and for genetic testing.
 -  Urine will be collected for routine tests.
 If you and the study doctor agree, you may be able to have the tests and procedures listed above at a clinic near your home. Please talk to the study staff about this possible option."

 Although the HBV prevalence is generally low in Western countries, such as Belgium, pockets of higher HBV prevalence exist in areas with large immigrant populations. Therefore national prevalence figures can underestimate the burden of HBV infection. The prevalence of chronic
 HBV in the population-based study in 2003 is believed to be an underestimate due to under-representation of the non-Belgian population. Moreover, by this time there are no data regarding the risk factors for HBV infection in the general population of Belgium.
 Even in low-prevalence areas such as Belgium, HBV prevention and control is a public health priority, particularly since safe and effective vaccines are available. The aim of this study was to evaluate the current prevalence and risk factors of HBV infection in a multi-ethnic neighbourhood situated in Middle Limburg, Belgium. Additionally, the investigators will determine linkage of care in hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive subjects."

 Total duration of the RCT is 12 months, with the first 6 month as the intervention period and the last 6 months as follow-up.
 Community-dwelling individuals with type 2 diabetes are eligible for participation in the trial, taking into account the in- and exclusion criteria described below, 160 participants will be included, 80 in each study arm. Study measurements of all participants will take place at baseline (month 1 (t = 0)), month 3 (t = 3), month 6 (t = 6, and month 12 (t = 12) at the Maastricht UMC+.
 Participants in the intervention group will be instructed to increase their LiPA by decreasing sedentary time. Participants will follow 4 workshops in group sessions on strategies to change their physical activity behaviour and will receive a feedback physical activity monitor that will be worn continuously on the wrist and provide e-feedback on activity behaviour.
 Participants in the control group will receive 4 workshops in group sessions on healthy lifestyle including information and strategies to increase LiPA and reduce sedentary time similar to the intervention group, but will not receive a feedback-activity monitor.
 Screening A preliminary screening will be carried out by telephone interview. If eligibility criteria are met the participant will attend the baseline visit which starts with the informed consent procedure. Afterwards, a standard physical examination will take place and an ultrasound scan will be performed to screen for large atherosclerotic plaques of the carotid arteries. If the participant is indeed eligible for inclusion, the investigational baseline measurements are performed after which randomization will take place. From then on participants will run through the protocol either being part of the intervention or control group.
 Measurements at the four investigational visits (t = 0, 3, 6 and 12)
 -  sociodemographic data
 -  medical history & medication use: by means of an interview
 -  lifestyle factors (alcohol use and smoking behaviour), quality of life, depressive symptoms - by means of questionnaires
 -  Sedentary and physical activity monitoring: by means of the activPAL® activity monitor for 7 days
 -  venous sampling (approx. 25 ml per person per visit; 5 collecting tubes of 5 ml) for fasting glucose, fasting insulin, HbA1c, lipid profile, creatinin, albumin and biomarkers of endothelial dysfunction (vWF, s-VCAM-1, sE-selectin, sTM, SICAM-1) and low-grade inflammation(CRP, SAA, IL-6, TNF-alfa, IL-8)
 -  Anthropometric data (height, weight, waist and hip circumference and bio-electrical impedance measurements)
 -  vascular measurement (arterial stiffness and blood pressure)
 -  physical function measurements (grip strength and timed chair test)
 -  Objective measurement of light-intensity physical activity through activPAL ® activity monitor that will be worn for 7 days continuously at baseline, month 3, month 6, and month 12. This device is blinded to the participant. Data from the activPAL provide detailed and accurate information on the participants' sedentary, standing, and stepping time for each day.
 Sample size calculation In order to be able to detect a 10% difference in PWV and similarly a 10% difference in carotid distensibility (the primary objectives of the study) after the intervention between the intervention group and the control group, both groups should consist of at least 73 participants each if assuming a probability of a type 1 error at 0.05 (i.e., alfa) and an 80% (i.e., beta) ability to detect a true difference between the intervention group and the control group. These estimates are conservative taking into account only PWV values at entry and exit of the trial. The 10% difference is speculative and based upon a mean PWV estimates from 'The Maastricht Study' data as there is currently no data available on LiPA and arterial stiffness. In order to correct for potential drop out (roughly estimated at 10%) 80 participants will be included in each group.
 Statistical analysis The significance levels used in the statistical analyses will be 0.05.
 The validity of the normality assumption will be checked for all outcomes. Baseline characteristics will be compared between the intervention and the control group. For continuous variables (e.g. age, BMI) mean and standard deviations will be presented; numbers and percentages will be shown for categorical variables (e.g. smoking, medication use).
 T-tests will be used to compare differences in continuous baseline characteristics between the intervention and control group and chi-square test will be used for categorical variables. Assuming that the randomization was successful, no differences are expected.
 Missing data will be imputed using multiple imputations techniques.
 Primary study parameter(s) The effect of the intervention on the primary outcome PWV at month 6 will be analysed using intention-to-treat (ITT) approach according to randomization assignment. The ITT analyses will be used as primary method for our statistical analyses and any outcomes in our reports will be primarily based upon these ITT analyses. In addition, a per protocol analysis will be performed for those who attended the workshops. These analyses will be used to gain some insights into any potential non-response / drop out. These per protocol analyses will not be the primary source for reporting outcomes. General linear models will be used to analyse the effect of the intervention on PWV at month 6. In addition, repeated measures will be taken into account, baseline, month 3, and month 6 using mixed models in SPSS. In these models, subject is entered as a random effect and intervention (categorical variable with 2 levels: 1: intervention; 2: control group) as a fixed effect
 .The baseline value of PVW and sex will be used as covariates in analyses.
 Secondary study parameter(s) Sedentary time, as measured by the activPAL will be analysed as total sedentary minutes on an average day as well as the percentage of sedentary during wake time. Similarly, time standing and stepping, also derived from the activPAL data will be analysed. All metabolic health parameters will also be analysed as continuous variables.
 Quality of life and mental functioning are also analysed as continuous variables. Finally, measures of body composition measures are also all continuous outcomes variables. Similar to the primary outcome analyses, general linear mixed models will be used the analyses the change the secondary outcome measures from baseline to month 6. Using mixed models, the repeated measures will be taken into account similar the analyses with the primary outcome.
 All analyses, for the both primary and secondary outcomes will also be conducted for the follow-up (month 12 data) to examine the long-term effect of the intervention, taking into account all repeated measures (baseline, month 3, month 6) in a mixed model.

 Sympathetic overactivity induces insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), so it is assumed that renal denervation (RDN) might improve glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity. Some clinical studies have shown that glucose metabolism is improved in patients with resistant hypertension both 1 and 3 months after RDN, and fasting glucose, insulin and
 C-peptide decreased significantly as did insulin resistance assessed by HOMA-IR. But in some clinical studies, RDN did not lead to a significant improvement of insulin sensitivity ≤12 months after treatment, and no effect in systemic sympathetic activity was observed after
 RDN. Therefore, the efficacy of RDN on glucose metabolism is still in controversy. The investigators wish to investigate the effect of multi-electrode catheter-based RDN on glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity in patients with T2DM."

 Pilot data from the (co-)applicants' laboratories suggest that EAE rats (animal MS model) and
 MS-patients suffer from significantly reduced muscle carnosine levels compared to healthy counterparts. The potential of β-alanine supplementation to elevate muscle carnosine content has been shown in healthy volunteers. Furthermore, the investigators have recently investigated β-alanine and carnosine supplementation in EAE animals. In MS, this has not been investigated yet. Therefore, the researchers' next step is to investigate the impact of β-alanine intake on exercise performance in MS patients. The investigators hypothesize that oral β-alanine supplementation improves exercise therapy outcomes in MS patients.
 So far, it is clear that β-alanine intake enhances exercise capacity of untrained, trained and aged individuals by improving contractile properties, maintaining higher intracellular energy levels and optimizing training adaptations. Because early fatigue of contracting musculature during rehabilitation is the predominant cause of exercise cessation, postponing exercise-induced fatigue by β-alanine supplementation will be clinically very relevant (improving exercise therapy efficiency). Consequently, the investigators aim to research the ergogenic potential of β-alanine intake in MS rehabilitation and hypothesize that β-alanine supplementation optimizes exercise therapy outcome (exercise capacity, muscle contractile characteristics) in this population."

 Hypothesis is that the intraoperative use of the combination of 1) the NoL index (given by the PMD200TM monitor, Medasense LTD inc, Ramat, Israel) to monitor pain levels and to guide opioids' administration during surgery, and 2) the BIS index (Medtronic, St-Laurent, QC,
 Canada) to monitor the depth of hypnosis during anesthesia and to guide the administration of anesthetic halogenous gases, will improve the quality of recovery as well as the safety after anesthesia in ERAS (Early Rehabilitation After Surgery) patients undergoing colonic surgery under general anesthesia + epidural analgesia.
 This study will compare a group of patients monitored by the classical monitoring (with anesthesia/analgesia guided by these classical parameters: heart rate, blood pressure;
 Control C group; no BIS, no NoL) to a group of patients monitored by the same classical monitoring implemented with the NoL/BIS indices (with analgesia/anesthesia guided by these 2 indices; Monitoring M group).
 The primary objective of the study will be the total consumption of desflurane that is expected to be significantly reduced in the M group. Secondary objectives will be evaluating safety and side effects of anesthesia and opioids and we expect a reduction of the following parameters: time for awakening from anesthesia, time for extubation, time for transfer to
 PACU, intraoperative opioid consumption, opioid consumption in PACU and for 48h, time for readiness for discharge from PACU, incidence of adverse effects such as: nausea-vomiting / sedation / respiratory depression / itching / dizziness / cognitive dysfunction in PACU and for 48h, satisfaction of the patients at 24 and 48hs, pain scores at rest and at mobilization in PACU, at 24h and 48h.

 The proposed study is designed to identify the level of tissue hypoxia in patients presenting with ascending aortic aneurysm. Ascending aortic aneurysms affect approximately 15,000 people in the United States each year, and represent a serious clinical problem because there is a known, but unspecified risk of aortic rupture or dissection. Despite progress made in the surgical management of ascending aortic aneurysms, the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved remain elusive. However, indirect evidence of tissue hypoxia have recently been described in the literature.
 This pilot study will use pimonidazole-HCl, a compound that is retained by hypoxic cells and that has been used for detection of tissue hypoxia in human since the early 2000s. This pilot study will involve twenty patients who are candidates for aortic replacement due to aneurysm and twenty non-aneurysmal patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (controls).
 Patients will be administered pimonidazole-HCl orally in a single dose (0.5g/m2) 24 hours prior to scheduled surgical time. During surgery, the resected aneurysmal aortic specimens (for patients undergoing aortic replacement) or aortic punch (for patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft) will be harvested. Tissue hypoxia will be qualitatively and quantitatively assessed in the investigator's research laboratory. Based on previous toxicological animal studies and previous use in human studies, the anticipated risk of severe or serious side effect will be relatively minimal."

 After signing informed consent and checking eligibility criteria participants will receive uniform education related to self-monitoring of blood glucose and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) using the CGM sensor as well as on the bolus calculator (BC). The study will take three weeks (or three sensors) per patient.
 Patients should live a close to normal life and should participate in their normal daily activities. During the study, patients must consequently keep using the BC of their insulin pump, record in the insulin pump when they eat extra food outside their regular meals and when they inject extra insulin without the use of their insulin pump. Faulty 'meal markers' have to be noted in a booklet and patients will also have to take pictures of their plate for each meal or record their meals in detail in a booklet. Patients should also consequently shut off insulin delivery when they disconnect their insulin pump and write it down in a booklet. The patients will be asked to wear an activity tracker (i.e. Fitbit), this data will help in the refinement of the model and will be used for research later in the same project.
 During the study, patients must skip a total of three meals: breakfast, lunch and dinner (not on the same day, but within the three weeks). This gives the investigators a period of measurements in which they know that there are no significant amounts of unpredictable carbohydrates in the blood. Patients can give correction insulin or take extra fast carbohydrates to correct the glycaemia when needed and record this in the insulin pump or in a booklet. The fast rescue carbohydrates should be in the form of Dextro energy tablets (provided by the study team).
 After the three weeks, patients will come back to the hospital where the study team will download data from the insulin pump, CGM sensor, and activity tracker.

 Fibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic, widespread pain syndrome. Individuals with FM frequently report body pain, fatigue, sleep issues, cognitive impairment, headaches, and other symptoms.
 The disease affects approximately 5% of women in the United States. Many of those patients suffer with decreased quality of life and loss of employment.
 The precise pathological mechanism of FM is not yet understood, and there is no targeted treatment for the condition. One hypothesis of FM with prior scientific support is that pain is caused by abnormal inflammation of the brain. When microglia cells in the brain adopt an inflammatory state, they release chemicals that can cause neurons to increase the transmission of pain signals.
 DXM has been used in previous research and demonstrated to suppress pain symptoms. When given at higher dosages (above 200mg), the medication acts as a dissociative agent. This dosage can reduce pain, but produces side-effects that can limit daily functioning. At lower dosages, however, DXM may reduce inflammatory aspects of chronic pain while not causing dissociative side effects.
 In animal models, central inflammation can be reduced with intraperitoneal dosages of DXM of 0.1mg/kg. In an average U.S. woman, this dosage would translate to approximately 8mg. Because an oral versus intraperitoneal dosing route will be used, the dose will be raised to 10mg, administered twice a day (once in the morning and once at night). The investigator will examine the impact of 20mg total daily DXM on self-reported FM pain."

However, people who were treated with old therapies, ones that were less effective and with higher rates of toxicity compared to current regimens, or who experienced AIDS defining illnesses, may be affected by HAND more frequently and more severely. Issues with cognition, memory, processing new information, problem solving, and decision making are all potential symptoms.
 Psychosocial interventions have been used to decrease stress and depression and improve coping and quality of life in the general aging population experiencing cognitive impairment and depression. These techniques, which can vary widely, have not been fully tested in people aging with HAND.
 CTNPT 029 (a pilot trial funded by the CTN) seeks to enroll 16 people at St. Michael's
 Hospital in Toronto. Study participants will be randomized to either receive cognitive remediation group therapy (CRGT) or standard HIV group therapy (control group). Both group therapies consist of a series of weekly 3-hour sessions led by a certified social worker and a peer. The CRGT group will spend one hour per session on brain training exercises (PositScience Software) and the remaining two hours on mindfulness-based stress reduction (meditation, breathing exercises, etc.). The control group will focus on general health and wellbeing for people aging with HIV. Study investigators will determine the usefulness of the structure of the sessions and the feasibility and acceptability of performing a study of this kind."

 Early Intervention (EI) services are provided to infants and toddlers with documented developmental delays in all 50 states and US territories. EI improves long-term infant-toddler adaptation and lowers the cost of care if parents use the services. However, depressive symptoms can reduce mothers' ability to provide the daily child development-promoting activities recommended by EI, increasing the child's risk for communication and behavioral problems. Indeed, repeated studies have shown that depressive symptoms reduce mothers' consistent use of developmentally sensitive, child-centered speech which, in turn, lead to negative child cognitive and behavioral outcomes. Previous research showed that over one-third of mothers of children with disabilities have significant levels of depressive symptoms, a rate higher than the population at large. Infants and toddlers of depressed mothers have been shown to receive fewer intensive services and have been shown to interfere with uptake of EI services through impaired mother-child interactions. A preliminary study by the investigators found that over a third of mothers of infants and toddlers enrolled in EI in a large North Carolina county had severe depressive symptoms and depression histories. Fortunately, the investigators also found that when depressed mothers were provided with concrete, attainable skills for improving interactions with their child, the impact of depression on both mother and child was substantially reduced. Focusing on a depressed mother's child-centered speech and reciprocal communication also improves child outcomes, even when the child is cognitively compromised. However, none of these specialized services are part of EI best practices. Thus, EI is an ideal setting in which to integrate screening, referral and targeted skills for depressed mothers in order to improve parent-child interactions and ultimately, child outcomes.
 This project will develop an intervention focused on communication between infants and toddlers with diagnosed or suspected developmental disabilities and their mothers who have depressive symptoms. The primary aim of the study is to test the feasibility and initial efficacy of embedding a language pedometer, the Language ENhancement Assessment/intervention system (LENA), into EI to teach mothers to increase child-centered speech and reciprocal communication, which have been linked to positive child outcomes, and to increase parenting efficacy in depressed mothers of children in EI.
 While maternal depressive symptoms can disrupt developmentally stimulating, child-centered speech, simple tools to assess and provide feedback to mothers can improve the child-centered speech and reciprocal language interactions that positively impact child outcomes. Although the LENA has been used in other studies and shown improvements in mothers' child-centered speech, the system has not been used with mothers showing depressive symptoms or in the EI context. The investigators will examine the efficacy of using LENA in a pre-/post-intervention design. Specifically, the investigators will examine whether mothers' primarily independent use of the LENA with feedback has an impact on the child's language environment, parenting efficacy and maternal depressive symptoms."

 At admission, pharmaceutics' team (senior pharmacist, one resident and two pharmacy students), conducted medication reconciliation process within 24 hours of admission or on the first working day following admission for admissions during week-ends. A medication reconciliation process was conducted according to a validated protocol. The first step consists of getting the Best Possible Medication History (BPMH), defined as the most comprehensive list of all medications taken by the patient. The second step consists of comparing the BPMH with admission prescription made by the physician in charge.
 During pharmacist interview, pharmacist discussed about medication adherence and knowledge.
 The third step consists of characterizing, solving and documenting DRPs. Each DRP highlighted by pharmaceutical team were collected and were classified regarding drug class and problem' types. For each patient with an identified DRP, the potential clinical impact was determined through a consensus of an expert panel: 2 pharmacists (1 hospital senior pharmacist and the resident) and 2 senior clinicians from the clinical department. The index used to rate the significance of the errors was based on the National Coordinating Council for Medication

 The proposed project addresses critical gaps in the understanding of the strength, specificity and persistence of neurobehavioral adaptions that occur in the initial period of repeated consumption of a branded sugar sweetened beverage (SSB). Half of Americans consume
 SSBs on any given day.
 Regular SSB intake is considered a contributing factor to excess energy intake, weight gain, and obesity, which impacts 70% of Americans. A contributing factor to repeated SSB consumption is sugar intake causes the release of dopamine (DA) and opioids in the striatum, providing positive reinforcement. As such, multiple brain-based models of food reward-driven obesity have been proposed, largely focusing on the striatum and executive functioning. These brain-based models of obesity have elucidated risk factors for overconsumption of high-sugar foods; however, data supporting these competing models rely heavily on observational studies in small samples.
 Importantly, previous reports from the investigators lab and others directly implicate eating behavior patterns as a vital contributor to aberrant neurobehavioral responses to food stimuli. However, without experimental evidence, there are fundamental gaps in the investigators knowledge about the neurobehavioral adaptations that occur as an individual begins to regularly consume a SSB prior to weight change.
 As observational data suggest, it is also crucial to examine individual difference factors that may exacerbate or protect against adaptations associated with regular SSB intake, as well as whether these adaptions are specific."

 Background
 Bariatric surgery is a common procedure. Data on patient related outcome beyond loss of body weight are scarce. The question arises which patient is at specific risk for an unfavorable outcome after bariatric surgery.
 Objective
 The aim of this study is to investigate variables possibly associated with impaired outcome and increased patients' interference after bariatric surgery. Which patients are at risk for clinically meaningful impaired daily living?
 Methods
 Patients will be enrolled in a prospective observational study. Data will be collected in a registry with documentation of patient, surgery, anesthesia and analgesia related variables including preoperative status and postoperative patient reported outcome with a follow-up period up to 5 years after bariatric surgery.
 Patients fill in standardized validated outcome questionnaires at predefined time points. The registry provides the basis for large scale analyses and benchmarks for several parameters.
 Variables to be considered are pain scores after surgery, patient reported outcome, pain related interference after surgery (Brief Pain Inventory), quality of life (SF-12), long-term outcome, chronic (neuropathic) postsurgical pain, BMI, psychological questionnaires, surgery and patient related variables, including genetic variants."

 Rationale: An electronic nose (eNose) is an artificial olfactory system that analyses volate organic compounds (VOCs) in exhaled breath. Exhaled human breath is mainly composed of inorganic compounds, inert gases and VOCs. VOCs are exhaled in very low concentrations and reflect pathological processes such as inflammation, oxidation, infection and neoplasms. The perspective is that metabolic and biochemical processes in several pathological situations cause different endogenous VOCs to arise, were they can serve as non-invasive biomarkers for certain diseases.
 Primary objective: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the AeonoseTM to distinguish the breathing pattern from patients with colorectal cancer from healthy controls using the previously established breathing pattern.
 Secondary objecitves:
 -  To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the AeonoseTM to distinguish the breathing pattern from patients with polyps (e.g. advanced adenomas, sessile serrated lesions).
 -  To determine the influence of colonic cleansing (laxative use) on breathing patterns.
 Study population: Adult patients referred for colonoscopy.
 Estimated sample size: 66 patients with CRC.
 Intervention: Participants will be asked to breath through the AeonoseTM for 5 minutes. There are no risks, nor benefits for the participants."

 The CREDO 2 study follows CREDO 1 study, which aims to construct an objective evaluation of endoscopic remission in Crohn's Disease (CD). In addition to reproducibility and validation, the predictive value of this remission evaluation needs to be tested in different settings to valorise its usefulness in clinical practice and in clinical trials.
 CREDO 2 aims to investigate whether the evaluation of endoscopic remission, as defined in
 CREDO 1, in patients in clinical remission is predictive of sustained clinical remission at 2 years. The design of CREDO2 is a multicentre longitudinal prospective cohort study. The screening period to include a patient is two weeks. Patients will be followed up to week 104.
 The primary endpoint is sustained clinical remission at week 104. The primary secondary endpoints are sustained clinical remission at weeks 26 and 52. The sustained clinical remission at 2 years is defined by the absence of relapse and complication of the disease.
 Relapse is defined as Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) > 220 or between 150 and 220 for 2 consecutive weeks with an increase of at least 70 points relative to the baseline CDAI, associated with an objective marker of inflammation: C-reactive protein (CRP) ≥5 mg/l and / or faecal calprotectin ≥250 μg/g. CD complication is defined by an intestinal resection surgery for CD, stricturoplasty, endoscopic dilatation, hospitalisation for intestinal strictures, abscess and / or fistula (including anoperineal disease) and/or therapeutic escalation. Therapeutic escalation is defined as an increase in the dosage of the treatment, shortening of the treatment interval, addition of a new treatment for CD (including corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, biologics, Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors or any experimental treatment). The number of patients to be included is 320 when using a two-sided test with a type 1 error of 5% to detect with a power of 80% an association between a predictor and week 104 sustained remission failure, corresponding to a variation in proportions of patients who failed from 40% in the high-risk group to 20% in the low-risk group, and assuming a 12% loss due to treatment discontinuation or patient withdrawal.
 Patients will be recruited via two cohorts. First, patients included in CREDO 1 could be included in CREDO 2 if they agree and meet the criteria of non-exclusion. Assuming that 2/3 of the 15 patients included in each of the 16 centres involved in CREDO 1 could be included in CREDO 2, 160 patients will be included from CREDO 1. An additional cohort of 10 patients per centre will be included in CREDO 2 by the same local investigator within each centre using the same methods as for CREDO 1 cohort, except that recruitment criteria will be those of CREDO 2, to provide 160 additional patients to reach the targeted cohort size for CREDO 2.
 Recruitment will therefore be performed in 16 centres and each local investigator will have to register 20 videos, including those selected from CREDO 1, stratified by endoscopic remission status according to his/her global judgment: complete remission; almost complete remission; neither complete nor almost complete remission. The main inclusion criteria are adult patients, with established CD with ileal and / or colonic involvement, without significant clinical activity for more than 3 consecutive months with, at baseline, CDAI <150 and CRP <5 mg / l and faecal calprotectin <250 μg / g, stable maintenance treatment for more than 3 months, an ileocolonoscopy planned for CD and the decision to maintain or decrease the treatment (but not increase) after the colonoscopy. All maintenance treatments are authorized
 / immunosuppressive (azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, methotrexate), biologic (infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab, golimumab, ustekinumab, vedolizumab) and JAK inhibitors.The main exclusion criteria are an incomplete record of the ileocolonoscopy or more than three resected ileocolonic segments (not counting ileocecal valve), taking NSAIDs in the two weeks prior to endoscopy, anoperineal MC without luminal involvement, suspicion of intestinal infection within 4 weeks prior to baseline endoscopic assessment. The expected period of recruitment is 12 months from the first patient included in the study and 20 patients will be included in each of the 16 centres in Belgium and France. At inclusion, demographic, phenotypic, medical history and treatment data will be collected and ileocolonoscopy will be performed and recorded by the local investigator using pre-specified standards, provided sufficient quality. Biological (albumin, haemoglobin, platelets, CRP and faecal calprotectin) assessments will be carried out at the inclusion and at each follow-up visit (week 26, 52 104 and unplanned). The clinical activity will be evaluated through CDAI. Within each centre, the local investigator, as local reader, will read the 20 ileocolonoscopy videos of the centre.
 In addition, each video will be read by central readers, selected among 12 central readers in four groups of 3 central readers. Each video will be read by 2 central readers and by a third one in case of disagreement between the first two. Each central reader will read a little more than 54 videos due to these disagreements. All these readers, local and central, will have undergone the training session validated by an examination on the evaluation of endoscopic remission. In a separate delayed session, the central readers will evaluate components of usual endoscopic severity indices. Agreement between data provided by local readers and central readers will be assessed through Kappa and intraclass correlation coefficient estimates. If agreement is satisfactory, endoscopic data provided by local readers will be used to investigate the association between baseline endoscopic evaluation and sustained clinical remission at week 104 using the logistic regression method, ROC curves, sensitivity and specificity. If agreement is poor, the association will be studied on central reader data using the same methods.
 This study should provide a tool to evaluate the ability of endoscopic remission evaluation in patients in clinical remission to accurately predict sustained clinical remission. If it is the case, this tool could become the therapeutic objective for patients in clinical remission with ileal and/or colonic CD. If agreement is satisfactory between local and central reading, the tool could be used in therapeutic trials, but also in clinical practice.
 If this is not the case, the tool should be used in clinical trials using central readings."

 The mortality caused by traumatic injuries in Africa is 116 per 100,000 population, compared to Europe with 49/100,000 population . In Kenya, which is a middle-income country in East
 Africa, the mortality caused by injuries is 101/100,000 population . Injuries, particularly those sustained through road traffic accidents, are a major cause of death in the African region. Statistics from the WHO reveal that, in 2015, 26.6/100,000 died in road traffic accidents in Africa. The corresponding numbers for Europe were 9.3/100,000 population . About 3000 people are killed annually on Kenyan roads, with an estimated road fatality rate of 29.1/100,000 population the affected predominantly from a productive young adult population.
 MOI University/Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital (MTRH) Eldoret, Kenya, is the second national referral hospital in Kenya with a catchment of over 22 million people. A previous study, focuses on evaluating the possible benefit of in-hospital triage for trauma patients admitted to the ED at the MTRH. The study illustrated a significant need for improvement in trauma care management and also resulted in the creation of a trauma database containing ICD codes and specific patient parameters.
 Although receiving increased attention, implementing strategies to improve trauma care in developing countries to address the health burden on the emergency care service is still warranted. Improved road safety legislation, reducing drunk driving, development of pre-hospital care systems , and strengthened hospital trauma care have been suggested as interventions to mitigate this problem in the health care system .
 Hospital trauma registers have played a key role in the advancement of patient-based research and trauma care. Trauma registers offer a unique opportunity to document patient characteristics and audit outcomes, thereby creating a platform for clinical research.
 Several scoring systems to assess injury severity with the aim of improving trauma care quality have been developed. One of these systems is the ICD-based Injury Severity Score (ICISS) derived from and validated on hospital data to predict hospital death. This powerful tool uses survival risk ratios (SRRs) to calculate the probability of survival for patients and allows accurate estimates of injury severity. To calculate ICISS, each ICD-code is assigned a SRR. Each SRR is equal to the proportion of patients who survived with a specific
 ICD-code in a reference population. In literature searches, there is lack of published SRRs from low income countries' trauma population."

 Patients with migraine show reduced cortical thickness in regions subserving pain processing, and it is related to increasing headache frequency. In the past, only one study has shown a reversibility consequence of chronic nociceptive transmission, which normalizes when the pain is adequately treated. However, little is known whether these changes predispose to migraine or represent the effect of repeated migraine attacks. Our region of interest is reduced frequency of migraine attacks are associated with reversibility of signal alternation and functional connectivity of cerebral cortex.

 Uganda has the fifth highest HIV burden globally and one of the highest fertility rates in
 Africa. Prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission Option B+ (PMTCT B+) is national policy in Uganda. To maximize the prevention and clinical benefits of PMTCT B+, the challenges of low HIV testing by male partners and high rates of post-partum discontinuation of ART, insufficient adherence, and incomplete viral suppression need to be addressed. Women may be more likely to continue ART long-term and have higher adherence post-partum if their partner is tested, there is mutual disclosure of HIV status, and their partner takes ART or
 PrEP, depending on his status. Innovative approaches are needed to allow men to test in settings other than busy antenatal clinics, preferably where they have privacy, are comfortable and do not miss work. Innovative HIV testing technology -HIVST- could increase male partner's uptake of HIV testing, and prevention (PrEP) or ART (for all HIV-positive men). This study has been designed to address this gap through an enhanced PMTCT B+ program with HIV self-testing, and linkage to PrEP or ART, for male partners.
 In a demonstration project the investigators recently completed among mutually disclosed East
 African HIV serodiscordant couples (the Partners Demonstration Project), integrated ART and
 PrEP delivery with time-limited PrEP for the HIV-negative partner as a 'bridge' until the
 HIV-positive partner was on ART for six months, and achieved viral suppression, was very acceptable, achieved very high uptake and adherence to ART and PrEP, and nearly eliminated
 HIV transmission. This protocol builds on that demonstration project by evaluating whether
 PMTCT outcomes are improved by increasing uptake of HIV testing and PrEP among HIV-negative men whose pregnant partner is HIV-positive. PrEP for HIV-negative male partners of
 HIV-positive pregnant women provides highly effective prevention benefits during an important
 'season of risk' when men may have higher HIV acquisition risk from their partner if she is viremic (during the first few months after ART initiation, post-partum ART discontinuation or due to viral resistance), or from outside partners.
 The investigators will conduct a randomized trial to evaluate whether provision of oral HIV self-test kits to HIV-positive pregnant women who are randomized to the HIVST arm, achieves higher uptake of their male partner's testing and linkages to HIV care and prevention among male partners, compared to invitation letters for fast track testing in the clinic (the standard of care). The investigators will recruit HIV-positive women ≥18 years accessing
 PMTCT B+ programs in Kampala, who have a male partner of unknown HIV status. Women will be randomized to the intervention (HIVST) or the control arm (invitation letters to deliver to partners to come for fast-track testing at the Antenatal Care (ANC) clinic where she receives care."

We offered the combination of ONS and IDPN to all patients however some of the patients refused this combination thus we had 4 groups as; Group 1 (patients received only ONS and refused parenteral nutrition; n: 14), group 2 (patients received only parenteral
 NS and refused ONS; n: 14), group 3 (patients received both oral and parenteral NS; n: 10) and group 4 (dietetic support group; patients who refused all types of nutritional support and only followed by counselling, n: 18) (Figure 1: Study Flowchart).
 All patients gave informed consent for this study, which was approved by the ethics committee of Baskent University School of Medicine.
 Nutritional supplementation Each patient was consulted monthly by a dietitian to achieve the target calorie intake of 35 kcal/kg/day. A snack providing approximately 300 kcal, 14 g protein, 55 g carbohydrate, and 10 g fat was served to all patients during the sessions.
 - Oral Nutrition Support (ONS): Patients in group 1 and 3 take ONS 200 ml/day twice a day at home. Each serving (200 mL) of ONS preparation (Nutrena;Abbott Nutrition, Zwolle, Holland) contained 400 kcal, 14 g protein, 41.3 g carbohydrate, and 19.2 g fat and had lower concentrations of sodium, potassium, and phosphorus than standard ONS. ONS consumption was recorded at each dialysis session.
 - Intradialytic Parenteral Nutrition (IDPN) Patients in group 2 and 3 received IDPN administrations [(Kabiven central; a sterile, hypertonic emulsion, for central venous administration, in a Three Chamber Bag; the solution contains dextrose solution for fluid replenishment and caloric supply amino acid solution with electrolytes, which comprises essential and nonessential amino acids provided with electrolytes and Intralipid® 20% (a 20%
 Lipid Injectable Emulsion), prepared for intravenous administration as a source of calories and essential fatty acids]. Its infusion was started 30 minutes after initiation of HD via the venous port of the bubble trap on the HD tubing and continued throughout the entire HD procedure at a rate of 150 ml/h for 30 min and consisted of 300 ml for 3 hour."

 Physiatrists use back braces (lumbar support, back corset, semi-rigid brace, and lumbar orthotic) for symptomatic management of patients' chronic low back pain (CLBP) despite very poor evidence supporting their use in the few published studies that have examined them.
 Evidence supporting back braces in other populations, such as pregnant women, and patients with sub-acute or acute low back pain, is better established. However, the benefits of back braces in the CLBP population are very unclear.
 A Cochrane review on the role of lumbar supports in treating chronic LBP revealed that limited evidence was available, which led to the conclusion that, it remains unclear whether lumbar supports are more effective than no or other interventions for treating low-back pain. The research emphasized the need for high quality randomized trials evaluating the effectiveness of back braces, and also recommended that compliance of brace wear be monitored.
 The mechanism by which back braces might help patients with CLBP is also unclear. The semi-rigid design of the commonly used back brace does not mechanically limit movement enough to suggest that movement limitation is the mechanism by which back braces provide relief.
 However, some studies have suggested that back braces help patients with CLBP by providing postural support or a kinesthetic reminder of their posture. Using posturography, Munoz et al., studied the forces applied by lumbar bracing and concluded that back braces seem to help by improving the quality of balance strategy used by the patient. Another mechanism by which back braces are believed to help patients is by providing warmth underneath the brace.
 There is poor published information regarding adherence to instructions (compliance) about the use of back braces. Based on the investigators' anecdotal clinical experience, adherence rates vary widely among patients who are prescribed back braces, ranging from non-use to constant use around the clock. Poor adherence to instructions can be a significant factor resulting in inconclusive evidence supporting the role of back brace in patients with CLBP. A recent study showed that a strong predictor for consistent adherence to back brace usage was a positive attitude towards it. In this study, positive attitude towards the back brace explained 41% of the variance in outcomes. In addition, investigators found that perceived benefit from the brace outweighed any subjective discomfort.
 Back braces have been used as adjunctive therapy in addition to other conservative care options. A recent study evaluated the cumulative effect of bracing to exercise and found that bracing helps to increase trunk stiffness and augments muscle contractions, which may remind the patients to better comply with exercise instructions. This suggested a potential synergistic effect of bracing and exercise in the management of patients with CLBP."

 Objective 1, Development of the expanded STROKE web program applicable to individuals with stroke in the USA.
 This is a necessary objective to achieve before the investigators can start the trial; but it has no associated hypothesis. One rationale is to expand the target population in terms of impairment severity based both on feedback from therapists and on the need to add more bilateral activities that are important for everyday use. The second rationale is to check that material is readable and applicable to individuals with stroke in the USA.
 Objective 2: To determine the immediate and durable motor function changes from a six-week web-based stroke rehab program vs. usual written exercise care in individuals discharged from outpatient therapy after a stroke.
 H1: Six weeks of web-based stroke training compared to six weeks of a written home upper limb exercise program will result in clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvement in upper extremity function immediately after the intervention and 4.5 months later.
 This primary hypothesis is justified based on the combination of two theoretical constructs as described earlier. First, there is evidence that web-based programs, based on Self
 Determination Theory principles, will show an increase in motivation to exercise vs. a control with no intervention in non-disabled individuals. Second, since the web-based program is also based on neuroplasticity and motor learning principles known to improve functional recovery, and not just physiological improvements, the participants should also improve their functional recovery rather than merely gain physical activity benefits while maintaining or even losing their functional level. Third, the pilot feasibility study supports this hypothesis for the immediate effect and, after the power analysis, for the follow up testing.
 Objective 3: To determine the immediate and durable behavioral benefits of a six-week web-based stroke program vs. standard care in individuals discharged from outpatient therapy after a stroke.
 H2: Six weeks of web-based stroke training compared to six weeks of a written home upper limb exercise program will result in statistically significant gains in motivation to exercise, self-efficacy and amount of practice time immediately after the intervention and 4.5 months later.
 This secondary hypothesis explores whether the STRONG program will improve the patients motivation to exercise and their self-efficacy, while the written exercise program has the opposite effect, by the end of the intervention. There is evidence from the non-disabled population that behavioral improvements such as increasing exercise time will occur when individuals are intrinsically motivated but this has not been shown in the stroke population using a LifeGuide platform web-based system27. Conceptually, the investigators predict that individuals with stroke will also become intrinsically motivated, because the program incorporates design details that enhance feelings of autonomy, competence and relatedness.
 Therefore, based on SDT, participants will not only have a better functional level but an increase in self-efficacy, motivation and independence. Specifically, during the 4.5 months after training, participants in the STRONG web program will demonstrate this by maintaining an increased amount of practice even though the investigators will have withdrawn our external support from the therapist (but not the participants ability to communicate with friends).
 Embedded Qualitative Component. Qualitative work is based on inductive reasoning and is hypothesis generating rather than hypothesis testing 49. Therefore, the investigators do not offer specific hypotheses but outline some of the questions that will be asked to give meaning and a context to the use of the web-based program.
 Objective 4: To determine the perceptions of patients/caregivers to the use of a web-based stroke training program.
 Qualitative methods will be used to explore patient and caregiver experiences and perceptions of using the Web-based system as part of stroke recovery to answer questions such as - In what ways did the STRONG web program help or hinder their rehabilitation? What did participants like and dislike about it? How did participants use it and why? What difficulties did participants have with using it? How could it be better? What did participants perceive to be the 'added value' of using the STRONG web program over routine practice alone?
 Objective 5: To determine the perceptions of therapists to the use of a web-based stroke training program.
 Qualitative methods will be used to explore therapists' experiences and perceptions of the
 STRONG web program in order to answer questions such as - What are the most important/useful aspects of the STRONG web program. What are the most difficult/problematic aspects of the
 STRONG? When would therapists use it and why? Who is it most successful for and why? What does it add to routine practice? In what ways does it detract from or complicate routine practice?"

 Schizophrenia is associated with poor social functioning, which is perturbed by deficits in social interaction including nonverbal communication. The use of hand gestures is critical for nonverbal communication, but the majority of schizophrenia patients has severe gesture impairments. Today no intervention may ameliorate gesture impairments. Patients with gesture impairments have altered structure and function of the gesture network, particularly the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and also the left inferior parietal lobe (IPL). Noninvasive brain stimulation techniques may alter local brain function. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and particularly theta burst stimulation (TBS) for a few mins is a very safe method to alter brain states locally for approximately 1 hour. Indeed, facilitatory stimulation of the left frontal cortex by transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) demonstrated improved gesture perception and interpretation in healthy subjects. In addition, inhibitory stimulation with continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) over left IFG may perturb gesture performance in healthy subjects. Thus, the investigators hypothesize that local changes of brain activity within the gesture network would change gesture performance.
 Particularly, facilitatory intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) of the left IFG would improve gesture performance. The investigators will test single sessions of rTMS in healthy subjects and schizophrenia patients. If one of the protocols proves to have superior effects, this result will help to plan interventional trials targeting social interaction deficits in schizophrenia. The aim of the study is to determine the effect of one session of iTBS over the left IFG on gesture performance compared to cTBS over the right IPL (active comparator) and one placebo rTMS sessions. This is a randomized, double-blind, cross-over, placebo-controlled single-center trial in 20 patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders and 20 healthy controls. After baseline assessment of gesture performance, participants will receive one rTMS protocol at each time point, immediately followed by assessments of gesture performance and dexterity. rTMS sessions will be separated by 48 hours. Gesture performance will be measured with video recorded Test of Upper Limb Apraxia, which is rated blindly according to a manual."

 Phase I Study Design
 • Phase I will follow a 3+3 dose escalation design to determine the RPTD of ixazomib in combination with ONC201 and Dexamethasone.
 The dose escalation rules for the phase I portion of the study are as follows, escalating in cohorts of 3 patients per dose level including a de-escalation option in case of early toxicity. Three patients will be treated at the current dose level. If at least 2 patients are observed to have a DLT, the prior dose level is defined as the RPTD unless only 3 patients have been treated at that level, in which case it is the tentative RPTD. If 0 of the 3 patients are observed to have DLT, the dose level is escalated one dose level for the next cohort of 3 patients, and the process continues as above. If exactly 1 of the 3 patients treated show DLT, 3 additional patients are treated at the current dose level. If none of these additional 3 patients show DLT, the dose level is escalated for the next cohort of 3 patients, and the process continues as above; otherwise, the prior dose level is defined as the RPTD (unless only 3 patients have been treated at that level, in which case it is the tentative RPTD). A tentative RPTD becomes final when a total of 6 patients are treated with less than 2 showing DLT.
 If, unexpectedly, at least 2 patients are observed to have DLT at the initial dose level 0, then the next dose level evaluated will be the lowest dose level, -2, and further dose escalations to dose level -1 will proceed as outlined above from that dose level. If there is no RPTD declared, there will be no expansion to the phase II portion of the study. The phase
 I portion of the study will include between 6 and18 patients depending upon the number of dose levels evaluated.
 Phase II Study Design Phase II will follow a Simon's Optimal two-stage design to indicate proof of concept regarding the PFS rate of ixazomib in combination with ONC201 and
 Dexamethasone at the RPTD established in phase I. Once the RPTD for combination therapy has been established, an additional 24 patients will be enrolled for a total of 30 evaluable patients (24 + 6 from phase I at RPTD).
 In considering a Simon's Optimal two-stage design, the plan is to look at each patient at 2 months after initiating study treatment (3 drug combination) and classify each patient as responder or non-responder at the 2 month time point. A responder is a patient who has stable disease or better (not progressed) since initiating study treatment; a non-responder is someone whose disease has progressed according to IMWG criteria. The population of relapsed and refractory MM patients in this study will likely all have progressed on standard therapy; therefore the null hypothesis being tested is that the disease control rate at 2 months is 5%. As per IMWG criteria, if patients show progression after 1 cycle of triplet therapy, they will continue on therapy and a repeat assessment will be performed after cycle 2 in order to confirm progression of disease.
 Stage 1:
 -  Enroll 9 patients including the 6 patients being evaluated from the phase I portion of the study
 -  Evaluate patients at 2 months post initiation of treatment
 -  If 0 have responded (progression-free), i.e. if all 9 have progressed, then stop trial for futility and conclude that the proportion who will be progression-free at 2 months is less than 5%.
 -  If 1 or more have responded (progression-free) at 2 months, then proceed to Stage 2.
 Stage 2:
 -  Enroll an additional 21 patients
 -  Evaluate patients at 2 months post initiation of treatment If 4 or more of the 30 patients have responded (progression-free) at 2 months then the null hypothesis is rejected and further investigation of this treatment combination is warranted."

 This study aims to demonstrate that a preoperative combination of mechanical bowel preparation and oral antibiotics, before elective laparoscopic rectal cancer surgery, is associated with a reduction of postoperative surgical site infection rate, as compared to mechanical bowel preparation alone.
 This study's hypothesis is that a preoperative colonic preparation including a combination of mechanical bowel preparation and oral antibiotics before elective laparoscopic rectal cancer surgery is associated with a reduced rate of 30-day postoperative surgical site infection, as compared to mechanical bowel preparation alone Preoperative mechanical bowel preparation (MBP) has been proposed in an attempt to reduce the colonic fecal load and to limit the risk of surgical site contamination, thus theoretically limiting the risk of postoperative surgical site infection (SSI). However, the benefit of such MBP before colorectal surgery is related to type of procedure performed. Indeed, several randomized controlled trials (RCT) and meta-analyses have demonstrated the absence of benefit of MBP before colon cancer surgery, whereas a recent RCT suggested that MBP before rectal cancer surgery was associated to a significant reduction of postoperative SSI, as compare to the absence of preoperative
 MBP.
 Recent studies suggested that the adjunction of oral antibiotics during MBP could help efficiently reduce the risk of postoperative SSI. Indeed, a recent meta-analysis of RCT have suggested that patients preoperatively receiving both MBP and oral antibiotics were exposed to a significantly reduced risk of postoperative SSI, as compared to patients receiving only preoperative MBP. This result was confirmed in a recent RCT which compared preoperative MBP and oral antibiotics versus MBP alone in a heterogeneous population of patients who underwent laparoscopic colonic or rectal surgery. However, to date, no RCT compared the outcomes of an
 MBP with oral antibiotics to MBP without oral antibiotics in a homogeneous cohort of patients undergoing rectal cancer surgery.
 This study aims to demonstrate that a preoperative combination of mechanical bowel preparation and oral antibiotics, before elective laparoscopic rectal cancer surgery, is associated with a reduction of postoperative surgical site infection rate, as compared to mechanical bowel preparation alone."

 This project focuses on understanding the cognitive and neural mechanisms by which mindfulness training (MT) results in positive behavioral change and enhanced psychological well-being. Although MT is rapidly gaining in popularity as a life-style intervention, there are still critical gaps in our understanding of its primary mechanism of action. Current theoretical frameworks suggest that MT operates by improving attentional control, emotional regulation, and self-awareness capabilities, potentially by targeting neuroplastic brain mechanisms of executive control. This suggests an important role for cognitive neuroscience research, but current work is still in its infancy, and subject to a number of well-recognized methodological and conceptual limitations. The proposed project aims to systematically remedy these limitations of prior MT research, by leveraging the unique opportunities offered by the Human Connectome Project (HCP), and on-going NIH R01-funded research. A key feature of the project is the use of a randomized, longitudinal discordant twin design, in which monozygotic (MZ; identical) twin pairs will be recruited, with one co-twin randomly assigned to the MT condition (mindfulness-based stress reduction, or MBSR; the most-validated and standardized form of MT instruction) and the other serving as a (wait-list) control. Each co-twin will undergo extensive behavioral and MRI neuroimaging assessments in a pre/post fashion, before and after the MT (or no-contact control) intervention, to test for specific MT-related effects. The discordant twin design, though never previously employed in an MT context, is widely recognized as one of the strongest for causal inference, since it avoids many of the challenges and confounds associated with inadequately matched control groups, and enables twin-pair focused analyses, which greatly increase statistical power. The investigators will use this design to investigate theoretically-focused hypotheses that stem from a guiding framework regarding the neural mechanisms of cognitive control. Specifically, using a newly developed cognitive control task battery, the investigator will test the counter-intuitive hypothesis that MT produces an enhancement in the neural mechanism and circuits associated with reactive (rather than proactive) control. An additional subset of MZ twin participants will undergo retesting with the original HCP protocol, in order to provide a comprehensive assessment and comparison of
 MT effect sizes across multiple domains of cognitive and brain function. Success in this project will have high relevance for public health, by providing innovative experimental tools and a novel theoretical framework from which to empirically evaluate and better understand the potential impact of MT programs as lifestyle interventions for enhancing psychological well-being in healthy populations."

 Before the IPC is inserted, you will complete 2 questionnaires about your quality of life and any symptoms you may have. These should take no more than 10 minutes to complete.
 You will be required to sign a separate consent form in order to have the IPC placed. Your doctor will give you detailed instructions about the IPC placement procedure, including its risks.
 You will have the choice to receive either an IPC alone or an IPC with doxycycline.
 Regardless of what you decide, you will be followed for up to 1 year.
 If you choose IPC with doxycycline, after the IPC is placed, the doctor will give you a prescription for a fentanyl patch to help control pain. The study staff will tell you how and when to wear the fentanyl patch and about any side effects that are related to fentanyl.
 About 5 days (+/- 2 days) after the IPC has been placed, you will have a clinic visit in which you will be checked up on as part of your standard of care. It is important that you wear your fentanyl patch in the morning before this visit. At this clinic visit, you will have a chest x-ray, you will be asked to rate your pain on a scale of 1-10, and you will be asked how much fluid has drained from your catheter at home. This is part of the standard of care, and you will be provided a container and method for measuring the amount of fluid.
 Based on the results of the above Day 5 check-up, if you are found to be ineligible to receive doxycycline, the fentanyl patch will be taken off and you will be followed as part of your usual care. However, you will still considered to be on study and you will be followed the same as a participant who receives the doxycycline.
 If you are found to be eligible to receive doxycycline, you will receive fentanyl by vein over a few minutes, if needed to help control your pain. Your doctor will then begin to drain your catheter and doxycycline will be placed in the catheter. The catheter will be capped for 1 hour and then drained again.
 Length of Study Participation:
 If you receive it, you will receive doxycycline 1 time. You will be followed for 1 year after the catheter is removed, regardless of whether or not you receive doxycycline. Your participation on this study will be over if you withdraw consent or the study closes, whichever takes place first.
 Follow-Up:
 Between 10 and 14 days after you have the catheter placed, you will come to the clinic as part of your usual standard of care so the doctor can check your IPC for possible leaking, infection, to see how much fluid has drained, and to remove any sutures. The catheter may be removed if it is leaking or shows signs of infection. You will continue to have this visit 1 time each month as part of your standard of care until the catheter is removed. During each of these visits:
 -  You will have a chest x-ray to check your lungs.
 -  You will complete the same 2 questionnaires that you completed before your IPC was placed.
 One (1) time each month for up to 1 year after the IPC is removed, you will be called and asked how you are doing, if you are having any side effects, if the disease has come back, and about your overall quality of life. Some of this information may be collected from your medical record. You will complete the same 2 questionnaires that you completed before your
 IPC was placed. Each phone call should last about 10-15 minutes."

 Mortality from liver disease accounts for approximately 34,000-36,000 annualized deaths and represents 11.5 deaths per 100,000 persons in the United States(1). Liver transplant is the only established treatment for end-stage liver disease (ESLD) and advancements over the past decade have resulted in excellent long-term survival rates(2). Liver transplant is limited solely by organ availability, as the numbers of available organs for transplant has remained stagnant. Compounding this problem is the rising global public health problem of fatty liver disease, with projected increases in incidence of non-alcoholic liver disease (NASH), both in the West and in Asia(3). One potential source of liver grafts is donors with moderate to severe macrosteatosis, as grafts from these donors are routinely discarded due to greater associated patient morbidity and mortality(4-6). When these grafts are used for transplantation, the clinical metrics of preservation injury are directly correlated with the degree of steatosis(7). Steatotic liver grafts represent the single largest source of potential donor livers that currently remains unutilized and methods aimed at their successful use would directly lead to reduced mortality in patients with ESLD. Evidence from pre-clinical models indicates that complement-mediated mechanisms play a critical role in the pathogenesis of preservation injury, particularly in the presence of macrosteatosis(8, 9).
 Expansion of the donor pool using established, FDA-approved therapeutics that inhibit terminal complement offer an expedited and practical solution to this problem.
 The investigators therefore hypothesize that complement activation downstream of C5 crucially mediates post-transplant liver allograft injury associated with preservation, ischemia and reperfusion (heretofore referred to as preservation injury) and that macrosteatosis enhances the graft's susceptibility to this complement-dependent injury. As a corollary, the investigators hypothesize that the anti-C5 mAb eculizumab will limit post-transplant preservation injury despite macrosteatosis, thereby decreasing early post-transplant liver dysfunction, and ultimately resulting in greater utilization of macrosteatotic livers for transplantation, with consequent reduction in mortality for patients with end-stage liver disease.
 This study will test safety and efficacy of complement inhibition with eculizumab in the ESLD population receiving macrosteatotic liver transplants. The study will also determine if known associations of hepatic lipid metabolism and innate immune responses are mitigated under conditions of complement inhibition.

 The results of the study of genetic polymorphisms performed in renal transplant patients at our hospital demonstrated the influence of CYP3A5 * 3 and CYP3A4 * 22 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) on exposure to Tac. From these results, the first population pharmacokinetic model was developed, which included CYP3A5 * 3 and CYP3A4 * 22 polymorphisms as well as hematocrit as explanatory variables of interindividual variability. Based on our population model and using the simulation tool, the percentage of patients reaching the therapeutic target based on Co values within the range of 6-10 ng / mL was determined after being dosed according to the strategy of Conventional dosage empirically according to Co achieved. The simulation of 50 Co values according to the conventional dosage allowed to determine the proportion of patients reaching the therapeutic target in each case and their confidence interval. 40% of the patients did not reach the therapeutic objective. Based on the clusters of the two polymorphisms, the percentages of patients on or below exposed varied according to whether they were slow or fast metabolizers respectively. Due to this high variability in Tac PK, the individualization of the Tac posology was calculated by calculating the initial dose according to the population model previously developed and adjusting the subsequent doses, as a function of the Tac Co through Bayesian approximations with the inclusion of genotyping and Hematocrit, can contribute greatly to achieve optimal exposure to the drug from the start of treatment in the immediate post-transplant and reduce the variability observed in the Co-achieved; This may be particularly important for patients with a slow and rapid metabolizer profile. All of this may contribute to minimizing adverse effects, ensuring greater efficacy in the target population, reducing the risk of acute rejection, and reducing associated costs.
 In the present study we intend to incorporate pharmacogenomics for its application in de novo patients, which will allow us to perform a more individualized therapy for each patient based on the values of target Co and the CYP3A5 * 3 and CYP3 A4 * 22 polymorphisms of the patient since The initiation of immunosuppressive therapy and thus improve efficiency and decrease adverse effects."

 Background:
 The Comet-program is a Swedish parent training program developed to target externalizing behaviors in children between 3-11 years. The program content is behaviorally oriented and the emphasis lies on increasing parenting behaviors that reinforces pro-social behaviors in children, as well as limiting the reinforcement of anti-social behaviors. The program is manualized and normally delivered in group format with parents to 6-8 children in each group.
 The group sessions (11 sessions á 2.5 hours) are led by two practitioners and include information, role-playing, and home-work exercises. The group format has been evaluated in two large randomized controlled studies. The effect sizes on child externalizing behaviors have been medium to large (Cohen´s d). Because of the evidence supporting Comet and other research supporting the effectiveness of similar behavioral parenting programs, Comet has been implemented in primary and specialized care in Sweden. A challenge in primary care is however the implementation costs related to the program (e.g., training of group leaders and the time each group leader need to invest in each patient). Therefore, Comet (or similar programs) are in practice used to a small extent in primary care, despite clear recommendations to offer such treatments for externalizing behaviors. A possible solution would be to offer an internet-based version of the program, which in two large randomized controlled trials have shown medium effect sizes on externalizing behaviors in children. In the internet-based version, the patients (parents) work online with seven modules over a period of nine weeks. Every module contains information, video-clips, quizzes and homework exercises. Every week the patient communicates with a therapist, that gives brief guidance and feedback online.
 The internet-based format of the program has however been implemented at a very small scale in regular care. One reason is probably reluctance on part of practitioners as well as patients in replacing face-to-face contact with online-contact. The management system used in health-care in Sweden is another obstacle, since only face-to-face contacts are included.
 Hence, the clinics are not financially compensated for any patient contacts online. To overcome these obstacles, the present study will compare the regular Comet program in group format to a modified version of the internet-based version. In the modified version, the online contact between the patient and the therapist will be replaced with three individual face-to-face sessions (45 min each). This will reduce the total amount of time invested per patient to 135 mins, compared to 410-550 mins per patient in the group format.
 Research questions:
 The primary research question in the study is: (1) Will the internet-based version of Comet be at least as effective as the group format in reducing externalizing behaviors in children?
 The secondary research questions will be to investigate if the two formats of Comet will differ in terms of: (2) cost effectiveness, (3) consumer satisfaction/applicability for patients as well as practitioners, (4) effects on parent behaviors and mental health, (5) effects on the quality of the relationship between parents and children, (6) effects on the quality of life experienced by the children, and (7) if the application of parenting strategies included in Comet mediates change in child externalizing behaviors.
 Method:
 To investigate these research questions, parents seeking help in primary care clinics for externalizing behaviors in their child will be recruited to the study. Six clinics will be involved in recruitment of participants and offering the interventions. Clinical psychologists on every clinic will therefore be trained in both formats of the Comet program.
 Enrolled participants will be randomized at each clinic to either take part in the group format or the internet-based format of Comet. The participants randomized to the latter format will start their treatment as soon as they have completed the first assessment, while participants in the group format will have to wait for the scheduled group to start (generally within 1-3 months after enrollment and first assessment). The post assessment will take place when participants have completed the intervention and the follow-up assessment will be 12 months after the first assessment point. In addition, parents in each condition will answer a few questions on a weekly basis during their interventions.
 Assessments at pre, post and follow-up will include parent ratings of child behaviors, parent behaviors, parent mental health, and consumer satisfaction/applicability (only at post assessment). At pre and post assessment blinded clinicians will also make a diagnostic assessment of Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) and Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity
 Disorder (ADHD) symptoms of the participating children. When the clinician meets the child for these assessments, the child will also be answering questions (structured interview) regarding their experienced quality of life. Finally, the psychologist involved in the treatments will continuously take notes in a log-book for each participant. The log-book will contain information on parent attendance, adherence and adverse events. A selection of the treating psychologists will also be interviewed to assess their experienced applicability of the two formats of Comet.
 The weekly questions will measure child externalizing behavior and the extent to which the parents have completed homework exercises (parenting strategies).
 Since the primary research question is if the internet-based version of Comet is at least as effective as the group format, the power calculation was based on non-inferiority design. The first step is to decide the non-inferiority margin, which is the least acceptable difference between the conditions in order to conclude that the internet-based version is non-inferior.
 A conventional method for deciding this margin is to use 50% of the effect sizes found in previous studies of the already established intervention. When applying this method for the primary outcome measure, the calculation showed that 134 participants were necessary to include in order to achieve a power of 0.80. In other words, if there is truly no difference between the group format and the internet-based format, then 134 patients are required to be 80% sure that the lower limit of a one-sided 95% confidence interval (or equivalently a 90% two-sided confidence interval) will be above the non-inferiority limit.
 Most research question will be analyzed using methods from non-inferiority design, i.e., analyzing the difference between adjusted means at post and follow-up with regard to the non-inferiority margin. Primarily, these analyses will be performed on participants who completed the interventions and assessments (per protocol), since intention-to-treat analyses reduces power and increase the risk falsely concluding non-inferiority.
 For the second research question (cost-effectiveness), the clinical significance in each condition will be calculated and compared (i.e., the proportion of participants that have recovered, improved, are unchanged or have deteriorated). Thereafter, the cost per patient for each treatment will be calculated and used to achieve an estimate of cost per recovered/improved participant. This method has previously been applied in a cost-effectiveness analysis of Comet and other parenting programs.
 The analyses of practitioner satisfaction and experienced applicability will mainly be descriptive, due to lack of power (to few practitioners involved in treatment) and due to fact that part of the data is qualitative (interviews).
 Finally, the analyses of mediation (research question 7), will be analyzed using Latent
 Growth Curve Modeling, which is suitable for data that is measured repeatedly during an intervention."

 Background: Hereditary ichthyosis are rare genetic diseases characterized by an abnormal epithelial keratinization due to mutations in gene involved in skin barrier. Patients present with scales on the whole body. Recent classification basically distinguishes syndromic from non-syndromic forms. Ichthyoses are severe diseases with significant impact on quality of life, due to troublesome symptoms (pruritus, pain), lack of effective therapy and complications such as ophthalmological anomalies. Among ophthalmological abnormalities, some are well known, such as eyelid abnormalities, including ectropion, and sicca syndrome.
 Conversely, corneal abnormalities such as keratoconus are not or very partially described in ichthyosis. The keratoconus is characterized by a corneal thickening and bulging with progressive loss of vision that may require a corneal transplantation. Its prevalence is 0.05% in its symptomatic presentation but may reach 10% when considering subclinical keratoconus diagnosed on basis of corneal topographies. These forme fruste keratoconus or keratoconus suspect may remain subclinical or instead progress to severe keratoconus. Corneal collagen crosslinking has been shown to strengthen the cornea in order to halt progressive keratoconus, justifying the need for early screening. Keratoconus is a complex condition of multifactorial etiology. With regards to the pathophysiology of the keratoconus, some hypotheses incriminate the corneal epithelial differentiation that is similar to the epidermal differentiation altered in ichthyosis. This link between both dermatological and ophthalmological abnormalities is supported by clinical experience. It's was observed that ichthyosis patients have frequently a subclinical keratoconus. In clinical practice, ophthalmological abnormalities are not commonly investigated in ichthyosis patients and there are no data on prevalence in the literature. Furthermore, there are no guidelines on screening or therapy of ophthalmological abnormities in ichthyosis.
 The purpose of this project is to demonstrate that the prevalence of subclinical keratoconus (including forme fruste keratoconus and keratoconus suspect) is higher in ichthyosis compared to healthy controls.
 Descriptive analysis of the studied population for primary outcome: The proportion of patients with subclinical keratoconus (including form fruste keratoconus and keratoconus suspect) will be described in each study-group and compared between study-groups using Mac
 Nemar Test."

 -  Purpose: The direct anterior approach to the hip has been suggested to have several advantages compared to previously classical approaches. However, no studies focused on the effects of these different surgeries on patients' perception recovery and walking efficiency according the initial physical fitness. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to compare the effects of surgical procedures on perceptual walking skills and efficiency according to the patients' physical fitness.
 -  Abstract : Some earlier studies report differences between surgery types in self- reported mobility, functional recovery and residual hip pain [22, 23]. The direct anterior approach to the hip has been suggested to have several advantages compared to previously popular approaches through its use of an intra-muscular and intra-nervous interval between the tensor fasciae latae and sartorius muscles [16, 17]. However, patients' physical fitness, postural response and perceptual walking skill relation was not taking account. 80 patients will be tested, one before and at various times after hip surgery. In randomized conditions, our patients will be divided in two groups, according the surgery approaches and their physical fitness. All patients performed a

 Adults over 65 years are the fastest growing segment of Canada's population. Social isolation (defined as living alone with infrequent social contact and/or few social network ties) and loneliness (a dissatisfaction with the discrepancy between desired and actual social connections) are of growing concern, as individuals are living longer and often living alone or far from family and close friends. Both loneliness and social isolation are related to poor quality of life and overall well being. The internet and communication technology may be important tools to help older adults connect with family and friends, thus maintaining or even enhancing social connections. They help users overcome physical and spatial barriers to connect with others. However many older adults have obstacles to internet and technology use such as lack of knowledge and efficacy, and concerns over privacy.
 AGE-ON is a series of volunteer-run workshops developed in 2014 by the Regional Geriatric
 Program in Hamilton. The goal of these workshops is to teach older adults with limited computer knowledge how to use tablet computers to connect with friends and family and gather information related to issues of importance to them. Over six weeks, participants learn 1) basic features of the iPad; 2) how to use the internet; 3) how to take and view photos; 4) how to send and receive emails; and 5) other 'fun' functions. An initial pilot project conducted in 2014-2015 displayed an overwhelmingly positive response to the AGE-ON workshops by both participants and volunteers, generating local media attention and resulting in a large number of interested older adults being placed on a wait-list for future workshops.
 This response proved the interest and need for a program of this type in the community.
 Preliminary feedback was gathered from participants; the investigators would now like to use this feedback to improve and expand upon the existing curriculum, and conduct a formal evaluation of the workshops.
 Through this randomized controlled trial the study team will conduct a formal evaluation of the AGE-ON workshops. Tablet and internet use and self-efficacy, barriers to technology use, social isolation, loneliness and quality of life will be assessed before and after the workshops. Qualitative feedback from participants will be collected after each workshop, and in-person and telephone interviews will be conducted with participants at the end of the workshops.
 Based on preliminary findings from AGE-ON Level 1 pilot project, we expect that participants in the AGE-ON program will improve self-efficacy in using their tablet for variety of tasks, specifically communicating with family and friends, and accessing health information. We anticipate this will result in a reduction in social isolation and loneliness, and improvement in quality of life. We also expect that this benefit will extend beyond the individual participant themselves, to family members and friends of workshop participants. At the community-level, this project will establish partnerships between researchers at McMaster
 University (Portal team), clinicians (Regional Geriatric Program, central) and organizations that work with older adults in the community (YWCA, assisted living facilities)."
NCT03526848,211276,2018-10-25T00:00:00Z,Clinical Trial Description,211276,AACT,"
 The proposed study is an open label study of the safety and antiretroviral activity of 3BNC117 and 10-1074 in HIV-infected individuals with well-controlled HIV infection on combination antiretroviral therapy (ART). 3BNC117 and 10-1074 are two broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) that target different sites on HIV-1 gp120. Our hypothesis is that the administration of repeated infusions of 3BNC117 and 10-1074 in the absence of ART will be safe and well tolerated, will maintain viral suppression in HIV-infected individuals during analytical treatment interruption (ATI) and will interfere with the maintenance of the HIV-1 reservoir.
 Forty eligible participants will be randomized to either Group 1 or Group 2 in a 3:1 ratio:
 Group 1 (n=30): participants will discontinue ART 2 days after the first infusion of 3BNC117 and 10-1074, and will receive 6 additional infusions of both antibodies at weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20 (Part A). Participants will remain off ART until week 38, if viral suppression is maintained (Part B).
 Group 2 (n=10): participants will remain on ART and will be administered seven infusions of 3BNC117 and 10-1074 at weeks 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20 (Part A). ART will be discontinued at week 26 until week 38, if viral suppression is maintained (Part B).
 After screening, participants will remain on ART and undergo leukapheresis, and will have the option to undergo LN biopsies 2-4 weeks prior to first 3BNC117 and 10-1074 infusions.
 Participants enrolled in group 1 will discontinue their ART 2 days after the first 3BNC117 and 10-1074 infusions. Participants enrolled in group 2 will discontinue their ART at week 26. If the participant's ART regimen includes an NNRTI, the NNRTI will be switched to an integrase inhibitor-based regimen, 4 weeks prior discontinuing all antiretroviral drugs.
 During the ATI periods of the study, ART will be resumed if there is a > 30% decline in CD4+
 T cell count or CD4+ T cell count decreases to < 350 cells/μl from baseline (day 0) and these changes are confirmed during next visit. ART will also be re-initiated if the participant develops symptoms of severe acute retroviral syndrome or becomes pregnant. In addition, ART will be resumed according the following virologic parameters:
 Part A (wk 0 - wk 26), ART will be resumed if group 1 participants have 2 consecutive plasma
 HIV-1 RNA levels > 200 copies/ml.
 Part B (wk 26 - wk 38), ART will be resumed if group 1 or group 2 participants have sustained (> 4 weeks) HIV-1 RNA levels > 1,000 copies/ml.
 Part C (wk 38 - wk 48), group 1 and group 2 participants who have not met criteria to reinitiate ART will be offered to continue off ART with close monitoring. In Part C, ART will be resumed if the participant has 2 consecutive plasma HIV-1 RNA levels > 1,000 copies/ml.
 All participants will be followed for a total of 48 weeks from enrollment (day 0).
 Participants will be invited to return for a large blood draw after they reach at least 24 weeks of viral suppression after ART is re-initiated, if this occurs after the active study follow up period.
 Safety assessments will be performed at multiple time points following 3BNC117 and 10-1074 infusions. The effects of 3BNC117 and 10-1074 infusions on the HIV-1 reservoir of
 ART-suppressed HIV-infected individuals will be evaluated by several assays. These evaluations will occur at baseline (day 0) and at week 26."
NCT03546062,210222,2018-10-25T00:00:00Z,Clinical Trial Description,210222,AACT,"
 BACKGROUND Heart failure (HF) is an increasing disease, with a prevalence and incidence of about 1% and 0.15% of the general population respectively, affecting at least 300,000 patients in the USA. However, in cases of advanced heart failure, refractory to maximal medical therapy, and to devices supporting the heart rhythm and cardio-circulatory function, the only valid therapeutic option remains the cardiac transplant. Diabetic patients with advanced heart failure seem to benefit from this therapy not differently as compared to non-diabetics. On other hand, in patients with advanced heart failure and selected for heart transplantation, the diabetes may condition a different degree of structural and molecular pathology that is not present, or present at least in a different way in non-diabetics selected for same HF etiology, clinical features, and HF stage. Therefore, in this study authors will study the anatomical-pathological, cellular, and molecular characteristics, as the pathways of inflammatory, oxidative, apoptotic and epigenetic expression in diabetics vs. non diabetics affected by idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDCM) and therefore in the absence of ischemic heart disease, and referred to Heart Center for cardiac transplantation.
 Authors' study hypothesis is that diabetes can condition a different degree of structural, cellular, and molecular pathology in patients with IDCM Vs. non-diabetic patients, due to excessive metabolic activity, with increased synthesis and release of inflammatory, oxidative, and apoptotic molecules. These investigations will be focused on microscopic, histological and functional analysis of the cellular metabolism of cardiac tissue extracted from diabetics vs. non diabetics IDCM patients, and removed during cardiac transplantation.
 However, in a subsequent ex vivo phase authors will evaluate cellular, molecular, inflammatory and epigenetic effectors related to the different microscopic tissue pattern obtained from myocardial tissue samples. From authors' investigations, these new identified targets of the HF molecular and cellular processes in diabetics vs. non diabetics, may be used in the future as specific therapeutic targets to improve clinical outcomes in IDCM diabetics with advanced heart failure.
 MATERIALS AND METHODS Study population Authors will enroll a population of IDCM diabetics and non diabetics selected to receive a heart transplant. This study will be conducted at the
 Department of Medical Sciences, at the Department of Cardiac Surgery, and at the Department of Biochemistry of the University of Campania Luigi Vanvitelli. Selection, randomization and enrollment of patients will be carried out at the Department of Medical Sciences, followed by clinical follow up; Cardiac transplantation and cardiac tissue sampling will be performed at the Cardiosurgery Department; Molecular and cellular studies will be conducted at the biochemistry department. The follow-up will be 12 months. The diabetic pathology will be diagnosed according to the international guidelines of the American Heart Association.
 Inclusion criteria: patients aged > 18, <75 years, with indication to receive a heart transplant (survival score for accepted heart failure accepted (HFSS) at high risk, peak VO2
 <10 ml / kg / min after reaching the anaerobic threshold; arrhythmias recurrent symptomatic ventricles refractory to medical treatment, ICD and surgical), affected by IDCM with heart failure in NYHA class III / IV refractory to maximal medical therapy; diabetic and non-diabetic patients Exclusion criteria: contraindication to receiving cardiac transplantation; non-idiopathic dilated cardiopathy (valvulopathies, ischemic-infarct cardiopathy, etc.), acute myocardial infarction, acute heart failure, neoplastic disease, and chronic diseases that may influence the inflammatory profile both systemic and cardiac (cancer, chronic intestinal inflammation, hepatitis, AIDS) , and a life expectancy <6 months.
 All patients will be included in the study after signing informed consent to participate in the study. Routine analysis will be performed upon enrollment in the study, before cardiac transplantation and follow-up. During the follow-up (figure 1) clinical examinations, routine ecg and echocardiography will be performed regularly. Molecular study and cell study will be performed on myocardial tissue from explanted hearts. The study will be performed according to the Helsinki declaration.
 Intervention In this observational study, authors will evaluate a cohort of consecutive patients (diabetic vs. non-diabetic) affected by IDCM and heart failure in class III / IV
 NYHA refractory to maximal medical therapy and treated at the Division of Cardiac Surgery of the University of Campania Luigi Vanvitelli by cardiac transplantation. The study will be conducted in three different parts: human study, ex vivo cell study, molecular study.
 Human study: conducted in the Department of Medical Sciences and Cardiac Surgery, the enrolled patient will be treated by heart transplant, according to the international guidelines governing cardiac transplantation. After cardiac transplantation, a biopsy of myocardial tissue of the removed heart will be performed. The intervention will be conducted at the Cardiosurgery Division of the Luigi Vanvitelli University of Campania.
 Cardiac tissue analysis A portion of muscle tissue (50 grams) will be removed from the explanted heart, from which 3 portions will be obtained: a portion will be incorporated in the OCT compound and frozen in liquid nitrogen for immunohistochemical analysis, a second portion will be immediately frozen in nitrogen liquid and stored at -70 ° C for the isolation of RNA, and a third portion will be weighed, cut into small pieces (2 mm3) and transferred to a 12-well plate. Based on the weight of the tissue, serum-free DMEM (2 ml / g) will be added to the well and incubated at 37 ° C in a mild-fluctuated CO2 incubator. At 3 hours, the conditioned soils will be collected and centrifuged at 4 ° C for 10 minutes. The supernatants from cultures of epiphonic and subcutaneous adipose tissue will be stored in aliquots at -70
 ° C for the measurement of inflammation mediators released by ELISA.
 Blood samples
 Blood collection will be carried out on the morning of surgery and during the follow-up phases by peripheral venous blood taken in tubes without pyrogen with or without EDTA as anticoagulant. For plasma, the EDTA tubes will be placed on melted ice, then centrifuged within 20 minutes at 1500 g for 10 minutes at 4 ° C. The plasma will be stored in aliquots at 80 ° C for all ELISA tests. Serum glucose, lipid panels and inflammatory markers will be analyzed in the University of Campania's Biochemistry Laboratory.
 Inflammatory markers
 The authors will analyze the mediators of plasma and cardiac inflammation with ELISA (R & D systems) according to the procedure recommended by the manufacturer. ELISA standard kit they will be used for IL-6 measurements, and highly sensitive ELISA kits for TNF-alpha and IL-1 measurements. Intra-assay variability will be set at 10%, while inter-assay variability will be 15%.
 RNA analysis and Real-Time Reverse Transcription
 Samples of myocardial tissue will be minced in a TriZol reagent (Invitrogen) and homogenized completely on ice. The total RNA will be extracted from the chloroform and purified twice through the mini RNAasy columns. After the DNase treatment on a column, the RNA will be eluted with RNase-free water. Transcripts encoding various inflammatory mediators will be measured by the TaqMan real-time reverse-polymerase-RT (PCR) chain reaction with the TaqMan
 Gold RT-PCR and the PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). PCR primers and TaqMan probes will be obtained from Applied Biosystems and optimized according to the manufacturer's protocol. The PCR reaction conditions will be at 48 ° C for 30 minutes, at 95
 ° C for 10 minutes, followed by 40 cycles of 95 ° C for 15 seconds and 60 ° C for 1 minute.
 The GAPDH transcripts will be amplified in a separate tube to normalize the variance in the input RNA. The mRNA in various samples will be estimated by the relative standard method with a series of dilutions of RNA from human vascular cells or from leukocytes.
 Immunohistochemistry The authors will obtain frozen sections (10 m), which will be air-dried for 15 minutes and immersed in xylene for 10 minutes to remove the fat. The sections will then be hydrated in decreasing degrees of alcohol and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The selected serial sections will be immunosimochemical with the Universal Elite ABC (Vector
 Laboratories) kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, the sections will be incubated with 0.3% H2O2 in methanol for 30 minutes, followed by a block with horse serum or 5% goat. After washing in PBS, the sections will be incubated with primary antibodies for 1 hour in a wet chamber. Subsequently, the slides will be incubated with secondary antibodies for 30 minutes followed by avidin-biotin for 30 minutes. The sections will then be exposed to
 DAB and counterstained with hematoxylin. The following antibodies will be used: CD3 (Tlymphocyte, 1:50, Novocastra), CD68 (monocytes / macrophages, 1: 100, Dako) and triptases (mast cells, 1:50, Novocastra).
 Follow-up After being discharged from the hospital, all patients will be required to carry out control visits, as indicated by the authors on the management of patients post-transplant cardiac, at the Division of Cardiac Surgery of the University of Campania Luigi Vanvitelli and the sixth division of Internal Medicine of the University of Campania Luigi Vanvitelli
 . All patients will be monitored for 12 months after follow-up, by clinical evaluation (ECG, stress test, echocardiogram) to maintain HbA1c levels <7%, fasting glycemia between 90 and 140 mg / dl and post-prandial glycemia <180 mg / dl, as indicated in the guidelines for the management of diabetic and post-CABG patients. In the 12 months of follow-up, patient management will be conducted by telephone interview, physical examination (at discharge and 3, 6 and 12 after cardiac transplantation), ecg and echocardiography (at discharge and 3, 6 and 12 after cardiac transplantation); CMRI will be conducted at baseline and 12 months after
 CABG. Similarly, the bio-humoral evaluation will be conducted during all the follow-up phases.
 Statistical Analysis The study population groups (diabetics vs. non-diabetics) will be compared using the Pearson test for categorical variables and the Kruskal-Wallis test for continuous variables. Candidates for admission to the multivariate model will be identified by focusing on factors that will differ significantly (P value <0.05) in the univariate analysis between diabetics vs. non-diabetics. Cox regression will be used to construct the predictive model of mortality. The risk ratio for mortality will be adjusted for age, BMI, cholesterol, LDL, triglycerides and aspirin, ticlopidine, anti-aggregating agents, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors or sartans, antidiabetic drugs, statins, etc. present at the time of hospitalization for cardiac transplantation. Analysis of survival after cardiac transplantation will be performed using the Kaplan-Meier curve and Cox regression method.
 Mortality curves will be obtained separately for diabetic patients compared to non-diabetic patients, and then compared using the log-rank test. All tests will be considered significant if with a value of p <0.05. All analyzes will be conducted in 2 populations: diabetic vs non-diabetic patients after cardiac transplantation. For all analyzes the SPSS program will be used (version 21, IBM SPSS)."
NCT03546049,210223,2018-10-25T00:00:00Z,Clinical Trial Description,210223,AACT,"
 In a recent systematic review and meta-analysis about the efficacy and safety of endoscopic ultrasound-guided biliary drainage (EUBD) in comparison with percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD), there was no difference in technical success between the two procedures, but PTBD was associated with a lower level of clinical success, a higher level of post-procedural adverse events and a higher rate of re-interventions. The authors concluded that EUBD should be favored for biliary drainage when endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreaticography (ERCP) failed or wasn´t possible to perform due to anatomical reasons.
 The hypothesis of this prospective multicenter study is that PTBD wasn´t performed in an appropriate way to compare it adequately with EUBD. The following improvements should be done. First, color Doppler ultrasound-guidance for cannulating the bile duct should be used in PTBD. The transgression of blood vessels with the risk of severe intrahepatic bleedings or hemobilia can be avoided, which are common adverse events in PTBDs when it is performed by fluoroscopic guidance. Second, the access to the bile duct from the left side of the liver should be favored. The access from the right liver side causes more adverse events such as biliary effusion or pneumothorax, as well as more patient discomfort and pain. Third, implantation of the self-expanding metal stent should be performed in the first session as a one-step procedure. This has the advantage that no further re-intervention is necessary after insertion of an external or an external/internal drainage, an outcome which can cause further adverse events such as bile duct leak along the catheter, biliary ascites or catheter dislocation. Fourth, stent release should be performed under endoscopic luminal guidance. In this way, the positioning and the correct expansion of the distal tip of the metal stent can be observed directly in comparison with the stent release which is only controlled by fluoroscopic guidance.
 On the other hand, EUBD should be performed in its best manner (special metal stents included) with the three techniques that are usually necessary to perform a successful EUBD:
 EUS-guided antegrade transpapillary drainage, EUS-guided transhepatic drainage and EUS-guided choledochal drainage.
 The study focuses on patients with malignant distal (infra-hilar) bile duct obstruction.
 It is presumed that the technical and clinical success rate is equal (non-inferiority) but the adverse event rate, the number of re-interventions and the number of days of hospitalization may differ between the two interventions. An adequate number of cases (106 patients in each intervention, drop outs included) should be recruited to calculate relevant statistical differences.
 Furthermore, patients will be followed over six months after the intervention to calculate an estimated survival analysis (with and without palliative chemotherapy)."

 This is a Prospective Observational Study. All new patients in chronic pain OPD are been administered BPI questionnaire as a standard of practice in our institute, in the language best understood by them e.g. English, Hindi, Marathi, Bengali. The participants will be asked to complete it once during their first visit to the pain clinic, before the start of treatment or ongoing treatment for pain (Baseline) and then during subsequent visits (Follow up). Most chronic pain patients are advised to follow-up by one to two weeks. Patients who are willing to participate in the study will be included after obtaining an informed consent.
 Data will be collected from BPI, Chronic Pain Record form and EMR and will be analyzed.
 Demographic data, diagnosis, pain data sheet, drug treatment as well as other form of therapies will be recorded. There will be no direct communication with the patient and data of quality of life will be retrieved from pain clinic records.
 The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) long form and short form questionnaire is a validated multidimensional pain assessment tool developed by Cleeland and Ryan. It is one of the most commonly used measures for assessing both pain severity and interference with functions in adults with cancer, thereby satisfying two recommendations (assessment of pain to include both intensity and interference) set by the Initiative on Methods, Measurements, and Pain
 Assessment in Clinical Trials (IMMPACT) group. It is brief, self administered, easily understood and can be administered to large numbers of patients,.
 It contains three questions regarding pain intensity and seven regarding pain interference that are rated on an ordinal numerical scale with anchors of 0 (no pain/interference) to 10 (maximum pain/interference). Pain intensity is measured according to the worst pain experienced in the last three days, average pain in the last three days, and current pain.
 Pain interference assesses how that pain has affected general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with others, sleep, and enjoyment of life. The sum of the scores of the pain intensity items represents the summed pain intensity score and the sum of the scores on the pain interference items represents the summed interference score. In addition, the patient enters his pain localization on a body drawing and can give details of his current medication."

 Women who carry a pathogenic BRCA variant (PV) have a lifetime breast cancer risk of 55-70% and a lifetime ovarian cancer risk of 16-45%. Men with a PV are at increased risk for prostate, pancreatic and breast cancer. BRCA testing typically begins with a family member (proband) who is affected with cancer. If a PV is identified, probands are encouraged to communicate this test result with at risk relatives. Unaffected first- and second-degree relatives (FSDR), who are at 50% and 25% risk for carrying the PV, may then pursue genetic counseling and testing for the specific variant identified in the proband (targeted testing).
 Targeted testing is far less complex and expensive than testing probands and definitively distinguishes carriers from non-carriers. Such testing allows carriers to reduce their cancer incidence, morbidity and mortality through risk reduction and screening while non-carriers can avoid unnecessary medical intervention and their offspring can safely forgo testing.
 Despite these well-recognized significant benefits and clear guideline-based recommendations for genetic counseling and testing, only 28-57% of FSDRs undergo BRCA testing. This low rate of participation occurs despite high rates of result communication by probands, calling into question the quality of the information communicated and the accuracy of FSDRs understanding of the importance of the information. Additional barriers to counseling and testing include: limited access, lack of referral, time and travel commitment, and lack of proactive clinical approaches to facilitate uptake.
 Remarkably, there have been no randomized trials focused on increasing use of guideline consistent genetic counseling and targeted testing. Guided by the Informed Choice (ICM) and
 Health Belief Models (HBM), the investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial of proactive Web-based pre-test education plus streamlined telephone genetic counseling (W+T) vs usual care (UC) for unaffected FSDRs of PV carriers. Web-based pre-counseling education followed by streamlined telephone genetic counseling will be proactively delivered. Following counseling, participants will have the option to proceed directly to targeted testing. By proactively providing access to accurate genetic information and reducing barriers to genetic services, W+T is predicted to yield increased uptake of genetic counseling and testing.
 Aim 1: Evaluate the impact of web-based intervention plus brief telephone counseling (W+T) vs. Usual Care (UC) on uptake of genetic counseling and targeted genetic testing.
 Aim 2: Evaluate the impact of W+T vs UC on psychosocial outcomes.
 Aim 3: Evaluate mechanisms and moderators of W+T.
 Research Overview. The aim of this RCT is to evaluate the efficacy of proactively delivered
 Web Pre-Test Education plus Streamlined Telephone Counseling (W+T) for first- and second-degree relatives (FSDRs) of individuals who have recently received a positive BRCA test result (i.e., probands). The W+T intervention is designed to facilitate access to genetic education and counseling, foster informed decisions and reduce barriers to targeted genetic testing. The primary hypotheses are that W+T participants will have increased uptake of genetic counseling and targeted genetic testing relative to UC participants. Eligible
 FSDRs will be contacted for a baseline assessment. One-month following the baseline assessment, all participating FSDRs will be randomized (by family) to either W+T or UC. FSDRs will be reassessed at 1- and 6-months post-randomization and probands will be reassessed at 6-months post-randomization to enumerate additional testing in the family.
 Identification and Enrollment. Probands will be recruited within the clinical genetics programs at LCCC and George Washington University (GWU). The genetic counselor will obtain permission to recontact BRCA probands at the time of their test result disclosure. Three months following disclosure, eligible probands will be contacted for enrollment. At that time they will be asked for consent to access their genetic counseling/testing records and provide the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of all potentially eligible FSDRs. Participating probands will be asked to inform all potentially eligible FSDRs about the planned study contact.
 After obtaining contact information, potentially eligible FSDRs will be mailed a recruitment packet (introductory letter, study brochure, informed consent document, opt-out e-mail/address/telephone number). Two weeks later, a research assistant will call all FSDRs who have not opted out of the study. The RA will explain the study and answer any questions.
 At enrollment participants will be informed that written consent is required prior to randomization. They will also be informed of the randomization date and that they must complete their baseline survey before that date in order to participate in the study.
 Baseline Assessment. Individuals who remain eligible and interested can complete the 20 minute baseline survey via telephone by a trained RA or electronically. For those who do not return the consent document prior to the baseline, an RA will use an IRB-approved verbal consent for telephone baselines or electronic consent for electronic baselines. Written consent will be required prior to randomization.
 Randomization. Following the baseline, participants will be provided with a randomization date on which they will be contacted with their assignment. Participants will be randomized by family to avoid contamination. Randomization will take place 1 month after enrollment of the first FSDR in a family. At that point, FSDRs who have not completed a baseline will be ineligible for the study. Participants will be informed of the randomization deadline upon enrollment. On the randomization date, participants will be notified by email or phone, followed by a priority letter. For W+T participants, this letter will contain log-in information website instructions. For UC participants, this letter will include a list of informational resources (including a list of low-cost genetic counseling options).
 Interventions.
 Usual Care. As part of standard clinical genetic counseling, probands with a BRCA mutation are provided with an individualized summary letter that includes cancer risks, management recommendations and options, a family letter that identifies at-risk relatives and encourages them to share the test result with these relatives. All participants in both arms will receive these standard materials. As described above, following randomization, UC participants will be notified of their assignment and will receive a list of informational resources. Of course, they can pursue standard clinical genetic counseling on their own at
 LCCC, GWU or any other program.
 The W+T Intervention. The W+T intervention includes: Interactive Pre-Test Web-Education with direct genetic counseling scheduling; streamlined telephone genetic counseling; and for those who opt for testing, a telephone genetic counseling disclosure session. The W+T pre-test Web component is designed to provide comparable information to a traditional genetic counseling session for an FSDR of a mutation carrier. A detailed description of the content of the W+T is described in the treatment plan below. Participants will receive an individualized link to the website that is connected to their email address. They will be able to create their own password the first time they access the website, and then log back into the website in the future using their email address and created password. The website has a forgot password option, where participants can create a new password at any time. The study will provide participants with a toll-free support number to call if they have any questions. After reviewing the website, participants will be provided with the option to schedule a brief telephone genetic counseling session with a board-certified genetic counselor. This session will take approximately 15 minutes and is designed to supplement and reinforce the web-based information. This session will be provided free of charge. Participants can decline
 Genetic Testing. Genetic testing is not required as part of this study. Any participants who proceed with genetic testing will receive standard clinical testing for their familial mutation (or more extensive testing when clinically indicated). At the conclusion of the pre-test telephone counseling session, participants who wish to proceed directly to testing will have the process for testing explained by the genetic counselor and a test requisition form (TRF) including insurance information will be completed. Upon completion of the TRF, a
 DNA saliva collection kit will be sent via overnight mail to the participant. After participants collect their DNA, they mail the kit and all included paperwork to the lab in a pre-paid FedEx pack. Targeted testing will be for the specific PV identified in their family, and if Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ), also for the 3 BRCA founder mutations. In rare instances participants may have a particularly complex family history and will be appropriate for broader multiplex testing. This option will be explained by the genetic counselor during the telephone session.
 Telephone Genetic Counseling Disclosure. Telephone disclosures will be delivered by the same board certified genetic counselors who provided pretest counseling. Telephone disclosures will utilize our existing clinical disclosure protocol that includes: result disclosure with comprehensive interpretation; discussion of cancer risks and management options; implications for family members; referral to specialists as needed/indicated. Within a week of the disclosure session, participants will be provided with a copy of their results, pedigree and an individualized summary letter.
 Follow-Up Survey. Participants will be contacted for follow-up surveys at 1-month and 6-months post-randomization. These surveys will be similar to (but shorter than) the baseline survey."

 After allocation, patients would be assigned to Standard group or ClearSight group. All patients will be sedative with BIS-guided Propofol/Alfentanil Target-Controlled Infusion. The
 BIS will be maintained between 40-70 with electromyography(EMG) < 30%. Ce(effect site concentration) of Propofol is adjusted according to BIS score. Ce of Alfentanil is adjusted between 15-75 ng/ml. Patients have spontaneous respiration during the procedure with O2 simple mask. If the oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry(SpO2) < 95%, prescribe chin lift first. Nasopharyngeal airways is given if chin lift can not improve the saturation.
 Crystalloid, usually Lactate Ringer, is infused with the rate 4ml/kg/hr. The goal of Standard group is to maintain mean arterial pressure(MAP) > 60%. If MAP < 60%, 3ml/kg crystalloid is challenged in 10 minutes. If MAP still less than 60% after the second fluid challenge,
 Ephedrine 4-8mg iv is prescribed. ClearSight group is to maintain stroke volume(SV). If SV decreases more than 10%, 3ml/kg crystalloid is challenged in 10 minutes. If MAP still less than 60% after the second fluid challenge, Ephedrine 4-8mg iv is prescribed."

 Early T-cell precursor (ETP) lymphoblastic leukemia (ETP-ALL) is a neoplasm composed of cells committed to the T-cell lineage but with an unique immunophenotype indicating only limited early T differentiation. In the highly orchestrated development of T cell fate specification under physiological condition, the most immature early thymic progenitors (ETPs) retain multilineage potentials. ETP-ALL blasts have a characteristic immunophenotype, with reduced/absent expression of T-lymphoid markers CD1a, CD5, CD8; and positivity for at least one HSC and/or myeloid antigen CD34, CD117, HLA-DR, CD13, CD33, CD11b, CD65. Recent study shed light on the genetic landscape of adult ETP-ALL, which revealed that more than 40% adult
 ETP-ALL harbored histone modification mutations. Chidamide is a novel oral HDACi with promising activity in non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Based on the pediatric-inspired,

NCT03554668,209751,2018-10-25T00:00:00Z,Clinical Trial Description,209751,AACT,"
 Thiamine and magnesium play a critical role in glucose metabolism and deficiency results in the accumulation of anaerobic metabolites including lactate (1-3).
 Thiamine requires magnesium to be converted to its active form, thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) (4). TPP also requires magnesium to achieve activation of TPP dependent enzymes during metabolism of glucose (5, 6). The 'gold standard' for the measurement of thiamine status is the measurement of Erythrocyte Transketolase Activity (ETKA)(4, 7-9), and this enzyme's activity is dependent on the presence both thiamine pyrophosphate and magnesium (8, 10). ETKA may therefore represent a 'functional marker' of magnesium status (7, 9, 11, 12).
 Studies indicate that low plasma thiamine and magnesium are associated with a range of disease processes, many of which are inflammatory (13-17). Other lipid-soluble vitamins and minerals are known to decrease during the systemic inflammatory response (18, 19), however this relationship is not proven for magnesium. The systemic inflammatory response may therefore confound the interpretation of plasma thiamine and magnesium in the context of sepsis, surgery or autoimmune disease. Elective knee arthroplasty, provokes an inflammatory response and therefore provides an excellent controlled model for understanding the body's response to a systemic insult (19).
 Obesity is reported to be associated with magnesium deficiency (17, 20). Intracellular magnesium plays a key role in regulating insulin action, insulin-mediated-glucose-uptake and vascular tone (21-23). Several epidemiologic studies have shown that adults and children consuming a western type diet are consuming 30 - 50% of the RDA for magnesium (24, 25). This deficiency appears to be predominantly subclinical and therefore not routinely investigated.
 Obesity is also associated with thiamine and magnesium depletion (17, 20, 26, 27). Magnesium deficiency is also associated with a CRP rise (28-30). Thiamine status is proven to affect lactate concentrations in the blood (2, 3). Lactate accumulation is known to precede the onset of insulin resistance and be characteristically found in patients with obesity related diabetes (31-37).
 It is therefore possible that an underlying quiescent magnesium and / or thiamine deficiency may mediate insulin resistance. Thiamine, and its more lipid soluble derivative, benfothiamine, have already shown some promise in the treatment of diabetic complications.
 The therapeutic potential is intriguing, however the relation between acute changes in the systemic inflammatory response and thiamine and magnesium concentrations, require clarification. Failure to prove the reliability of the thiamine and magnesium measurements in the context of the systemic inflammatory response may lead to patients receiving treatment for a measured deficiency of red cell thiamine and serum magnesium concentrations, which is unreliable. If the therapeutic potential of combined treatment with thiamine and magnesium for the optimization of ETKA function is to be realized (8), it is essential that the erythrocyte and plasma values used to determine thiamine status are definitively established in the context of the systemic inflammatory response. The knee arthroplasty model affords the ideal study design for this as there is a strong association between obesity and knee osteoarthritis (38, 39). 1.

 Patients being evaluated for bariatric surgery often undergo preoperative upper endoscopy.
 Patients with obesity are at increased risk for sedation related adverse events during endoscopy. The study evaluated the effect of non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) to decrease the incidence of desaturation in patients with severe obesity undergoing upper endoscopy. The study was a randomized controlled trial that assessed the effectiveness of NIPPV in patients undergoing upper endoscopy. Patients were randomized into experimental group NIPPV or control group. Primary endpoints were desaturation events (SpO2 <=94%) and desaturation events requiring intervention (SpO2<=90%). A secondary endpoint was the use of
 NIPPV to rescue patients who developed a clinically significant desaturation event."

 The HIV epidemic in South Africa (SA) is among the highest in the world. SA has a large antiretroviral therapy (ART) program, but some individuals exhibit poor ART adherence, which increases the likelihood of developing drug resistance and failing the only available first and second line ART regimens in SA. ART nonadherence contributes to greater morbidity, mortality, and higher likelihood of sexual HIV transmission when virus is detectable. At the same time, alcohol and other drug use is prevalent among HIV-infected individuals in SA and associated with worse ART adherence, lower rates of viral suppression, and HIV transmission risk behavior. Yet, despite the impact of untreated substance use on poor HIV treatment outcomes and continued HIV transmission, there is little if any integration of substance use and HIV care services in SA, which creates a fragmented and incomplete system of care. This study had three phases, first being formative, qualitative work which led to a systematic treatment adaptation phase. This third phase, the clinical trial, is based on this formative work and other empirical support using behavioral interventions to improve ART adherence and reduce substance use in resource-limited settings, including SA. This study is a Type 1 hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial of a lay counselor-delivered behavioral intervention for adherence and substance use integrated into the HIV primary care setting in
 SA. To ensure that those who need this intervention most will receive it, participants will be patients with HIV who are struggling with adherence (as defined in the investigator's inclusion criteria) and who have an elevated substance use risk."

 Background: The Portfolio Dietary Pattern, which includes nuts, viscous fiber, plant protein, and plant sterols, has been shown to have a cholesterol-lowering effect similar to that of early statin medications. Despite the endorsement of the Portfolio Dietary Pattern by major international diabetes and cardiovascular guidelines, the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) guidelines for nutrition therapy have not made any specific recommendations for the Portfolio Dietary Pattern. The present systematic review and meta-analysis using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was thus commissioned by the Diabetes and Nutrition Study Group (DNSG) of the EASD to summarize the available evidence from controlled trials of the effect of the
 Portfolio dietary pattern on LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) and other established cardiometabolic risk factors.
 Need for proposed research: High quality systematic reviews and meta-analyses of controlled trials represent the highest level of evidence to support dietary guidelines and public health policy development. As dietary guidelines and public health policy have shifted toward food and dietary-pattern based recommendations, there is a need for a systematic review and meta-analysis assessing the pooled effect of the Portfolio Dietary Pattern trials on cholesterol and cardiometabolic risk factors.
 Objective: The investigators will conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize the effect of a Portfolio Dietary Pattern compared to control on lipids and other cardiometabolic risk factors in controlled clinical trials.
 Design: The systematic review and meta-analysis will be conducted according to the Cochrane
 Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and reported according to the Preferred
 Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA).
 Data sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials will be searched using appropriate search terms supplemented by hand searches of references of included studies. Authors will be contacted for applicable missing data.
 Study selection: The investigators will include controlled dietary trials. Randomized and non-randomized controlled trials will be included if they are >= 4 weeks duration and assess the effect of the Portfolio Dietary Pattern on cholesterol and cardiometabolic risk factors compared to a control diet.
 Data extraction: Two or more investigators will independently extract relevant data and assess risk of bias using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. All disagreements will be resolved by consensus. Standard computations and imputations will be used to derive missing variance data.
 Outcomes: The primary outcome of the systematic review and meta-analysis will be the established lipid target for cardiovascular risk reduction, LDL-C. Secondary outcomes will include other blood lipids (total-C, triglycerides, HDL-C, non-HDL-C, apolipoprotein B (apo
 B)), adiposity (body weight), inflammation (C-reactive protein), blood pressure (systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP)), glycemic control (HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose, fasting blood insulin), and the Framingham risk score for the estimation of 10 year coronary heart disease (CHD) risk.
 Data synthesis: Mean differences and standardized mean differences will be pooled for the outcomes noted using the generic inverse variance method. Random-effects models will be used even in the absence of statistically significant between-study heterogeneity, as they yield more conservative summary effect estimates in the presence of residual heterogeneity.
 Fixed-effects models will be considered where there are <5 included studies and large precise trials are being combined with smaller imprecise trials. Paired analyses will be applied for crossover trials. Heterogeneity will be assessed by the Cochran Q statistic and quantified by the I2 statistic. To explore sources of heterogeneity, the investigators will conduct sensitivity analyses, in which each study is systematically removed. A sensitivity analysis will also be conducted comparing trials where food was provided with trials where participants received dietary advice, but not provided food. If there are >=10 studies, then the investigators will also explore sources of heterogeneity by a priori subgroup analyses by age (children [=<18 years of age], adults), health status (metabolic syndrome/diabetes, overweight, normal weight), comparator, baseline measurements, randomization, study design (parallel, crossover), follow-up (=<8-weeks, >8-weeks), and risk of bias. Meta-regression analyses will assess the significance of categorical and continuous subgroups analyses. When
 >=10 studies are available, publication bias will be investigated by inspection of funnel plots and formal testing using the Egger and Begg tests. If publication bias is suspected, then the investigators will attempt to adjust for funnel plot asymmetry by imputing the missing study data using the Duval and Tweedie trim and fill method.
 Evidence Assessment: The strength of the evidence for each outcome will be assessed using the
 Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE).
 Knowledge translation plan: The results will be disseminated through interactive presentations at local, national, and international scientific meetings and publication in high impact factor journals. Target audiences will include the public health and scientific communities with interest in nutrition, diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease.
 Feedback will be incorporated and used to improve the public health message and key areas for future research will be defined. Applicant/Co-applicant Decision Makers will network among opinion leaders to increase awareness and participate directly as committee members in the development of future guidelines.
 Significance: The proposed project will aid in knowledge translation related to the role of the Portfolio Dietary Pattern in cholesterol-lowering and cardiometabolic risk, strengthening the evidence-base for guidelines and improving health outcomes by educating healthcare providers and patients, stimulating industry innovation, and guiding future research design."

 Premature ovarian failure is a loss of normal function before age 40, leading to infertility and hypoestrogenism. While POI is sometimes called premature menopause, it is not the same thing as menopause. Women with POI may still have occasional irregular periods and may even occasionally achieve a pregnancy. Symptoms of POI include: irregular menses or amenorrhea, infertility, hypoestrogenic symptoms and decreased libido. POI may be caused by Chromosomal defects such as mosaic Turner's syndrome, exposure to toxins (chemotherapy or radiation), autoimmunity, genetic factors (FMR1) and other unknown factors.
 Autologous Platelet Rich Plasma (A-PRP) is plasma with a concentration of platelets above the blood baseline. A-PRP is developed from autologous blood. Within A-PRP, the concentration of platelets delivers an increased number of growth factors. In this study A-PRP will be prepared using Regen Lab PRP Kit which is approved by US-FDA for preparation of PRP.
 PRP is becoming widely used in a variety of medical procedures seeking tissue remodeling and/or healing as an intervention. To date, applications in orthopedics, wound healing, dermatology and plastic surgery have gained general acceptance, primarily as the role of platelets and their activation in tissue repair and recovery has become better understood at a cellular and molecular level. This knowledge base provides a foundation for the present study because of the ready availability of FDA-approved kits for autologous PRP preparations and the recognition that the aging ovary acquires tissue pathologies in the form of wound healing and fibrosis as a result of repeat ovulations over the reproductive lifespan of women. Since PRP is an autologous blood product, and is widely used via injection into various organs and tissues, safety concerns are minimal.
 This study will involve only adult women with a diagnosis of POI. Consenting participants will receive injections of autologous Platelet RIch Plasma (A-PRP) in one randomly selected ovary under ultrasound guidance performed after induction of IV sedation. Randomization will determine whether the right or left ovary will be treated. The result of randomization will not be recorded in the participants clinical chart, but will be maintained in the research database with blinding to all clinical participants. The physician performing the A-PRP administration will not perform post procedure follow-up of those patients. In case of a complication, possibly related to treatment, the case will be unblinded.
 The study will be powered to detect a 20% response in the treated ovary (every patient's 2nd ovary will serve as control). This will require 68 ovaries and 34 patients. The study, thus, does not involve randomization of patients because each patient's second ovary functions as control ovary, although which ovary will receive treatment in a given patient will be determined by computer randomization."

 Directors , Flight Surgeons , medical residents and medical students on NASA rotation , and
 NASA/contractor employed University of Texas Medical Branch physician's). Findings from the study will also further inform BHP 's development of an education training program related to countermeasures for sleep loss, circadian desynchronization , fatigue, and work overload for astronauts as well as ground crews who work night shifts in support of missions. Results of the study will also inform the human system health and medical standards and requirements for future exploration missions.
 The study protocol was successfully pilot tested in the study titled Develop and Implement
 Operational Ground Testing Protocols to Individualize Astronaut Sleep Medication Efficacy and
 Individual Effects (Phase I) with N=7 subjects (6 NASA flight surgeons and 1 BHP Operations professional) as subjects from March through June , 2009. The pilot study results supported the scientific feasibility of conducting a randomized , blinded , placebo controlled study of sleep medication effects on alarm-based awakenings. Preliminary analysis from the pilot study indicated differences in performance upon abrupt awakening between the sleep medication and placebo conditions. Thus, the pilot data also supported the likelihood of new scientific and clinical insights from the Phase II studies with astronauts and the additional analogous populations (e.g., Flight Controllers, Flight Directors, Flight Surgeons, medical residents and medical students on NASA rotation, and NASA/contractor employed University of Texas
 Medical Branch physician's) .
 In the study titled Operational Ground Testing Protocol to Optimize Astronaut Sleep
 Medication Efficacy and Individual Effects (Phase 11), two randomized , blinded , placebo-controlled , cross-over trials will be conducted. The hypnotic medication and the placebo will be indistinguishable by subjects. Experiment 1 will involve N=14 subjects randomized to placebo , 10 mg Zolpidem (Ambien) and 10 mg Zaleplon (Sonata) in counterbalanced order and will be awakened 90 min. post-placebo administration (half at 60 min and half at 90 min). The latter will be done to maintain some degree of blinding relative to the participants knowledge of conditions and the staff working on the protocol. Zolpidem is the most commonly , and Zaleplon is the second most commonly , used sleep aid medication used in spaceflight. Females and those subjects who have had a previous adverse experience with 10 mg zolpidem will be placed into Experiment 2, which will involve N=20 subjects randomized to placebo , 5 mg zolpidem and 10 mg zaleplon. Data acquisition for both experiments will occur in the Astronaut Quarantine Facility (AQF) at JSC. Experimental methods and cognitive outcomes will be the same as those used in the pilot investigation titled Develop and Implement Operational Ground Testing Protocols to Individualize Astronaut
 Sleep Medication Efficacy and Individual Effects (Phase I). Combined , Experiment 1 and 2 will provide data on zaleplon 10 mg compared to placebo on a total of 34 subjects consisting of astronauts and other subjects considered analogous to the astronaut population (e.g.,
 Flight Controllers, Flight Directors , Flight Surgeons, medical residents and medical students on NASA rotation, and NASA/contractor employed University of Texas Medical Branch physician's) , which will provide the larger sample needed to identify those subjects who have cognitive performance deficits on abrupt awakening to the less sedating 10 mg zaleplon.
 This is an applied study and it is not feasible to include two or three doses of each drug in order to determine a dose-response curve based on each of the drugs pharmacodynamics.
 Literature has shown that zaleplon 10 mg will be less disruptive on performance at awakening than zolpidem 10 mg and that zaleplon 20 mg is likely to be comparable in effects to zolpidem 10 mg. However , zaleplon 20 mg is not a commonly used dose in space, whereas zolpidem 10 mg and 5mg, and zaleplon 10 mg are used-hence the study will focus on these drugs and doses.
 More importantly , the goal of this study is not to determine whether these dose-by-drug comparisons are likely to yield the same average results in astronauts as has been found in the general population (e.g., Roehrs et a., 1994; Wesensten et al., 1996; Greenblatt et al., 1998; Hindmarch et al., 2001). Instead , we began by are focusing on individual astronaut vulnerability to hypnotic sedation on awakening , and having a limited number of astronauts who can realistically participate in the operational research was not realistic or conducive in completing the study. We needed to expand our astronaut population to include international astronauts and other populations deemed analogous to the astronaut population (e.g., Flight Controllers, Flight Directors , Flight Surgeons, medical residents and medical students on NASA rotation,and NASA/contractor employed University of Texas Medical Branch physician's) . We want to evaluate as many astronauts on these drugs and doses as possible , and in a manner that permits comparisons between both drug type and dose; however , it became necessary to broaden our subject pool in order to reach the desired N. Thus Experiment 1 will evaluate 10 mg zolpidem for males and zaleplon 10 mg relative to placebo in N=14 astronauts and analogous subjects (e.g., Flight Controllers, Flight Directors, Flight Surgeons, medical residents and medical students on NASA rotation,and NASA/contractor employed University of
 Texas Medical Branch physician's). Experiment 2 will evaluate zolpidem 5 mg and zaleplon 10 mg relative to placebo in N = 20 additional astronauts and other analogous subjects (e.g.,
 Flight Controllers , Flight Directors , Flight Surgeons, medical residents and medical students on NASA rotation,and NASA/contractor employed University of Texas Medical Branch physician's)."

 Small fiber neuropathies, and mixed small and large fiber neuropathies, have many potential causes including diabetes, vitamin deficiencies, environmental and toxic exposures, HIV, autoimmune and paraproteinemias.
 However, despite this broad differential at least 30% of cases of small fiber neuropathies remain idiopathic. There is therefore a growing interest in the potential for using IVIG in small fiber neuropathy without direct proof that the disorder is caused by immune reactions.
 We have recently uncovered two novel autoantibodies, TS-HDS and FGFR-3, that are targeted again peripheral neural structure. TS-HDS is a disaccharide component of glycosylation of heparin and heparin sulfate.
 Patients with elevated levels of IgM against TS-HDS display clear small fiber loss with IgM deposits around the outside of medium- & larger-sized capillaries with C5b-9 complement deposits. FGFR-3 is a secreted cell surface receptor; genetic defects of FGFR-3 are linked to achrondroplasia and other bony abnormalities.
 The antibodies to TS-HDS and FGFR-3 are detected in up to 20% of patients with otherwise idiopathic small fiber neuropathy, but are rare in patients without small fiber neuropathy.
 Dr. Levine (a co-investigator on this project) recently presented 3 cases of small fiber associated with elevated levels of auto-antibodies to TS-HDS or FGFR-3 who were treated with
 IVIG at 2 gm/kg/month for 6 months. He examined skin biopsies for intra-epidermal nerve fiber density and patient self-reported pain scores at baseline and after six months of therapy.
 All 3 cases showed marked improvement in pain scores. The average reduction in pain was 54%.
 In addition there was a clear increase in the intra-epidermal nerve fiber density (IENFD) after 6 months of therapy. Pre-treatment IENFD was 1.6, 1.7, and 2.4 at the calf. After 6 months of therapy the IENFD was 8.4, 5.7, 3.3 respectively (these are clinically significant improvement in nerve fiber density.
 The investigators believe these anecdotal cases suggest that TS-HDS and FGFR-3 antibodies may be a marker for a group of SFN patients that are immune mediated and may respond to IVIG. (This case series was presented as a poster at the American Academy of Neurology meeting in 2017)"

 Recently, our group found the prevalence of ROS1 rearrangement reached up to 3.2% in clinically selected population (never smokers) and 5% in genetically selected population (EGFR-/ALK-wild-type). These data strongly suggests that ROS1 rearrangement is a potential therapeutic target with relatively high incidence. In this study, investigator confirmed the presence of ROS1 fusion by RT-PCR and correlation between FISH and IHC (Cell Signaling
 Technology®).
 LDK378 is an orally highly selective and potent ALK kinase inhibitor. In preclinical studies,
 LDK378 has much lower IC50 values than crizotinib in cell lines engineered to express ROS1 rearrangement (0.15 nM versus 3 nM) and is approximately 20-fold more potent. LDK378 is a potent inhibitor of tumor growth in rodent models of both ALCL and NSCLC.
 Investigators suggest a phase II trial of LDK378 in advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients with ROS1 rearrangement. The aim of current trial is to evaluate the antitumor efficacy and safety profile of LDK378."

 Different anesthetic regional techniques can be used for anesthesia and analgesia of the lower abdominal surgeries such as caudal, spinal, epidural, transversus abdominis plane block, ilioinguinal nerve block, lumbar plexus block, the field block and abdominal paravertebral block. The use of regional anesthesia with ultrasound guidance can help decrease complications of regional blocks.
 In the lumbar area, the lumbar paravertebral space is a potential space formed by the vertebral bodies, intervertebral discs and intervertebral foramina medially, the psoas major muscle anterolaterally and the erector spinae muscles, the transverse process and intertransverse ligaments posteriorly. There is no costotransverse ligament in the lumbar region. The lumbar spinal nerve roots run through the paravertebral space then continue through the psoas major muscle where they form the lumbar plexus.The spinal nerves in this space are devoid of a fascial sheath making them exceptionally susceptible to local anesthetics. The diaphragm and psoas muscle separate the thoracic and lumbar paravertebral areas; however, communication may occur via the medial and lateral arcuate ligaments of the diaphragm.
 Field block can be done by subcutaneous injection of a local anesthetic in an area bordering on the field to be anesthetized. It is safe, simple, effective, and economical, without post anesthesia side effects. Furthermore, local anesthesia administered before the incision produces longer postoperative analgesia because of local infiltration, theoretically, inhibits the build-up of local nociceptive molecules, and therefore, there is better pain control in the postoperative period.
 The aim of this study is to compare the analgesic and autonomic effects of unilateral abdominal ultrasound guided paravertebral block with field block in pediatric inguinal hernia surgery.
 This study hypothesizes that unilateral abdominal ultrasound guided paravertebral block may be more superior to field block in reducing intra and postoperative pain in the pediatric inguinal hernia. The analgesic efficacy and duration of ultrasound (US) guided unilateral lumbar paravertebral block and field block were compared when dexmedetomidine and epinephrine were added as adjuvants to bupivacaine."

 Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a chronic, severe and disabling mental disorder with unclear aetiology and pathophysiology concerned with neuro-developmental,neurodegenerative abnormalities and cognitive impairments linked to behavioural changes.According to neurotrophic hypothesis, the changes result due to the abnormal regulation of neurotrophic factor, especially the decreased serum brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) validated by several meta-analyses.
 However, the regulation of nerve growth factor (NGF) in SCZ remains unclear because of the inconsistent findings from the previous clinical studies.
 Lurasidone is a novel antipsychotic drug approved for adult SCZ and for affective symptomatology & cognitive deficits. Principal advantages over some other second-generation antipsychotics are its highly favourable metabolic profile and once daily dosing regimen.
 Some of the studies indicate that risperidone, olanzapine, clozapine & aripiprazole might not alter BDNF levels, at least within 8 weeks of treatment.While other two studies with olanzapine suggest that BDNF might influence the response to monotherapy in SCZ patients.All these previous studies are non-conclusive & contradictory to each other which draw our attention for doing the research further to reach a conclusive result about the effect of olanzapine and lurasidone on neurotrophic biomarkers in SCZ.
 Most of the antipsychotic drugs prescribed for SCZ are based on the dopamine hypothesis. In recent times, neurotrophic hypothesis gained importance in the pathophysiology of SCZ. So, our study may enable psychiatrist to choose a better antipsychotic drug having effect on both dopamine as well as neurotrophic factors. Previously there were no studies on effect of lurasidone on neurotrophic factors in SCZ & also there was no head-on comparison of lurasidone and olanzapine"

 Design Investigators will perform a prospective, multicenter, pragmatic, observational study of adults presenting with traumatic head injury at the ED.
 All data necessary for analysis including predictor variables and outcome data for all the seven guidelines included in the study will be registered (table 1). Patients will be managed clinically accordingly to the judgment of the responsible physician and/or local guidelines.
 Study setting and population The study will be set in Halmstad, Malmö, Lund, Örebro and
 Linköping, Sweden. Hallands Hospital Halmstad (HS) is a level II trauma centre, Skåne
 University Hospital in Malmö and Lund (SUS), Örebro University Hospital, Linköping University
 Hospital are level I trauma centers.
 The coordinating site for the study will be HS where the statistical and the comparative biomarker analysis will be performed.
 Inclusion criteria From September 2017 investigators will prospectively enroll all adult patients with a GCS 9-15 that seek the ED within 24h after TBI.
 Exclusion criteria
 -  patients younger than 18 years of age;
 -  patients without a Swedish personal identification number due to difficulties in performing the follow up phase;
 -  all patients that refuse to participate.
 Data registration and follow-up Details of how patients are managed, including patient characteristics, injury type, patient history, clinical examination results, current medications and CT findings will be documented in a pre-determined case-report form by the triage nurse and/or physician on call.
 All patients will be asked to answer a questionnaire sent by mail 3 months after the injury.
 The questionnaire will be re-sent if no answer is received. If no answer is received from these attempts, patients will be contacted via telephone. The questionnaire includes questions that would identify a significant intracranial lesion, data concerning sick-days, new contacts with medical professionals and information concerning quality of life. In cases where patients can not be reached by mail or telephone, medical records and national mortality databases will be consulted for evidence of complications and/or death. The Swedish health care system allows full visibility of data for persons with a Swedish personal identification number for medical records and mortality database over the whole country.
 Patients who suffer significant (enough to seek medical care) intracranial complications after discharge would therefore be identified.
 Details on study period are specified on figure 1 with an algorithm for patient eligibility and data analysis.
 Data will be registered in an Excel® file. Descriptive statistics will be analysed using IBM
 SPSS® Statistics Version 20 software.
 S100B analysis A 5ml blood sample is drawn from patient's cubital vein in the ED. Samples are analysed with the fully automated Elecsys® S100 (Roche AB) at the Clinical Chemistry
 Department of HS, SUS, Örebro University Hospital and Linköping University Hospital, Sweden.
 Cut-off level for normal levels of S100B according to the SNC guidelines is less than 0.10μg/L and a window of sampling of within 6 hours from the time of the injury.
 From all patients seeking care within 24h form injury with medium and low risk TBI, according to SNC13 (including multitrauma patients), a 5ml blood sample will be drawn, centrifuged and frozen at -70 degrees Celsius. Samplings will be coded and registered for analysis of GFAP,
 SBP-50 and TAU.
 CT examinations CT scans are always analysed by a board certified radiologist.
 Sample size The Scandinavian guidelines will recommend discharge (i.e. neither CT nor admission) in approximately 50% of patients and a prevalence of our primary outcome of 5% (from our own observations and from data derived from a pre-selected cohort) . Allowing for one missed case, a sensitivity of >99% with a lower 95% confidence interval, a sample size of 2490 patients is required to detect traumatic intracranial complications according to the
 SNC13. Allowing for a 10% lost to follow-up, the desired sample size is 2767 patients.
 Interim analysis After 1000 patients, the prevalence for the primary outcome will be measured in order to be able to reevaluate sample size.
 Ethics Ethical approval was granted from the Regional Ethical Review Board of Lund (approval number 2012/574).
 Informed verbal consent will be obtained and registered by nurses responsible for triage at
 ED.
 Patients' data and social security number will be stored and handled accordingly to Swedish
 Personal Data Act, (PUL 1998: 204).
 Written consent will be obtained from all patients from whom the extra blood sampling for biomarker analysis will be requested. Sampling will be coded and patients will be able at any time to refuse to be part of the study."

 AIMS AND OBJECTIVES 1. To evaluate the success of primary endodontic treatment following use of 5% and 1% NaOCl in non-vital, posterior teeth. 2. To compare the success achieved following use of the two different concentrations of
 NaOCl. 3. To evaluate postoperative pain following use of 5% and 1% NaOCl.
 MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mature mandibular first and second molars with diagnosis of pulp necrosis (as confirmed by negative response to cold and electric pulp testing), and having apical radiolucency were chosen for the study.The consenting subjects were allocated to one of the two study groups based on concentration of NaOCl used: 5% [high concentration (HC)] and 1% [low concentration (LC)].Using an equal proportion randomization allocation ratio, envelopes containing concealed assignment codes were assigned sequentially to eligible patients.It was ensured that neither the patient, nor the primary investigator was aware of the treatment protocol before beginning of the treatment procedure.
 CLINICAL PROCEDURE: 2% lidocaine with 1/80000 epinephrine was used to achieve profound local anaesthesia.
 After proper isolation with rubber dam, access cavity was made with a high speed handpiece and carbide bur.
 Debridement of the pulp chamber was done and all canal orifices were identified Lubricant (RC
 Prep) was placed at the entrance of the canal and canals negotiated with 10 no. K file.
 Working length was established 1mm short of apical foramen by electronic apex loactor (Root
 ZX) and confirmed radiographically.
 Root canal preparation was done by using rotary files according to manufacturer's instructions.
 In both groups, 5ml of sodium hypochlorite was used as irrigant after each instrument change.
 All the irrigation procedures was performed using a 30 gauge needle. 5% and 1% NaOCl was used in HC and LC, respectively.
 After root canal instrumentation, canals was irrigated with 5ml of 17% EDTA solution for 1 minute followed by final wash with 5ml of 5% or 1% sodium hypochlorite, depending on the group.
 Canals were dried with sterile absorbent paper points and filled with calcium hydroxide paste and the access cavity restored with Cavit.
 The patients were recalled after 1 week. At the next appointment, the paste was removed with the use of Hedstroem files and copious irrigation with 5% or 1% sodium hypochlorite followed by 5ml 17% EDTA and a final rinse with 5ml 5% or 1% sodium hypochlorite.
 Then, canals were obturated with the Gutta percha by lateral condensation technique and Zinc
 Oxide- Eugenol based sealer in both the groups.
 After obturation, the cavity was restored permanently. Immediate post-operative radiograph was then be taken.
 All the patients were prescribed Ibuprofen 400mg with the instructions to take only one tablet every 8 hours in the event of pain, if needed.Patients were asked to record the severity of pain using 10 cm VAS scale with 0 depicting no pain and 10 depicting maximum pain imaginable. Patients were asked to make a mark on the line that represented their level of perceived pain at 6 hr ,12 hr ,1 day,2 days,3 days,4 days,5 days,6 days and 7 days.One week later, patients returned with the completed questionnaires.
 Follow up clinical and radiographic examination carried out every 3 months, till 12 month period."

 Around a fifth (19%) of the UK adult population has experienced depression or depressive symptoms. The overall direct and indirect costs of treating mental illness, such as depression, are estimated at £105 billion per annum. As much as 80% of mental health care takes place in G.P surgeries or hospitals, putting increased strain on existing services and increasing pressure to find suitable alternatives. One UK based RCT investigating technology as a remote intervention for physical illness reported a 15% reduction in A&E visits, a 20% reduction in emergency admissions and an 8% reduction in tariff costs. Systematic reviews of
 Video-Conferencing (VC) have also shown reduced costs in relation to home care and access to on-call hospital specialists.
 There is growing evidence to suggest that individuals will firstly go online for health information before seeking professional advice. As much as 4.5% of all internet searches are for health information accounting for approximately 1 out of every 20 search queries on
 Google. Those who seek health information online may also wish to access services however, the quality of interactive support online is questionable. A recent Cochrane review of interactive telemedicine has shown evidence of the effectiveness of VC based therapy for mental health issues. The current Secretary of State for Health has also supported the use of
 Skype technology as part of a 'radical redevelopment' of health services. This is in tandem with the launch of Northern Ireland's eHealth strategy in March 2016, adding to a number of policy documents suggesting this technology has the potential to increase access, lower costs and promote early intervention.
 In spite of this evidence base, VC services for mental health are not widely available. As such, the full risks and benefits for clinical purposes are unknown. Several studies have shown the mental health benefits of VC as comparable with face-to-face therapy. However, the acceptability of this approach may depend on factors, such as age and technical competence.
 After reviewing the outcomes of VC based treatment for clients with bulimia, asserted the distance and space provided by video therapy may have helped these clients to engage in treatment to a greater extent than would have been possible face-to face. VC has shown to be effective in the treatment of mental health conditions as well as increasing engagement for groups who would otherwise struggle to do so using face-to-face services. VC has the potential to increase access to services, target hard-to-reach groups and reduce G.P and hospital waiting times by providing alternative support mechanisms. Given the ubiquitous nature of online technologies, services are easily available and accessible which may enable preventative processes to occur sooner.
 This study will address the feasibility and acceptability of group based video-conferencing support groups for adults with depression. Findings will inform the design and development of a randomised controlled trial.
 Aims & objectives To test the acceptability and feasibility of delivering a peer led support group intervention for depression using VC technology. 1. To gather data sufficient to undertake a power calculation to determine the number of participants needed for a full scale RCT. 2. To explore the acceptability of randomisation within a future RCT design. 3. To establish suitability of recruitment methods. 4. To conduct a parallel qualitative study of the potential advantages and disadvantages of
 VC support for depression. 5. Test measures needed for economic appraisal. 6. To gather data in relation to likely interest in the service. 7. Gather preliminary evidence of the potential of the intervention to reduce depression.
 Study design and methods Study design will be informed by the development and feasibility stages of the Medical Research Council (MRC) Framework for complex interventions using mixed methods. The project will involve two core phases. Phase one will focus on intervention development and in-house testing of the intervention protocol. This will include interviews and observations with facilitators, staff and current AWARE NI service users. Phase two will involve delivery of an eight week group based VC support service for adults with depression.
 Outcome measures for phase two will be recorded at baseline, week eight and at six months.
 Participants will include adults (18+) seeking support for depression. Facilitators will be
 AWARE NI staff and/or volunteers who are trained and experienced in delivering face to face group support meetings.
 Phase 1: Intervention development, training and in-house testing During Phase 1, focus groups and interviews will be conducted with current service users to explore issues, such as the benefits of a VC support service, the barriers to accessing such a service and any suggestions regarding its current development. Member(s) of the research team at QUB will also observe face to face support groups.
 In house testing will be conducted with AWARE NI staff to identify and address practical issues for example in using equipment (for example setting up cameras/speakers), logging in to the video conferencing site (Google Hangouts) as hosts and instructions needed to support staff. QUB researchers will observe staff and facilitators using the technology and interviews with staff and facilitators after testing.
 Subsequently, a protocol will be produced for facilitators to complement the training programme. The manual is expected to include guidance around practical issues e.g. logging in as facilitators; checks that should be made at the start of each session (such as internet connection); alerting members as to when sessions will be beginning; checking sound issues; and informing the group if a member of the research team is observing the VC session.
 Guidance will also relate to dealing with drop outs and maintaining attendance records.
 Current service users, staff and facilitators will be recruited through a convenience sampling method. Participant Information Sheets and Consent forms will be provided to group members through their group facilitators.
 Phase 2: Intervention delivery and evaluation Approximately 4 - 6 VC groups (6-8 participants per group) will be delivered on a weekly basis for eight weeks. Groups will be facilitated peer facilitators from AWARE NI who are trained and experienced in delivering face to face support groups. Groups will be hosted securely through Google Hangouts. The online group will mirror the structure and format of face-to-face groups. Evaluation of groups will involve collection of outcome measures using validated instruments, interviews with group members/facilitators and observations of groups (described below).
 Recruitment Advice was taken from the research team's statistician (Dr Chris Cardwell) and the Northern Ireland Clinical Trials Unit on sample sizes required for the feasibility study.
 As such, a total of 100 participants will be sought for this study.
 Online support groups will be advertised as a new service by AWARE NI on the home page of the organisations website. Invitation to participate will be through an introductory page. The advertisement will specify that AWARE NI are expanding their services to include a new online support group service and that QUB will be working with AWARE NI to evaluate this new service. If participants are interested in the service and in taking part in the evaluation, they will be invited to click on a link that will lead to further information (the
 Participant Information Sheet). Consent will be obtained online in the first instance as a necessary step in registration and reaffirmed verbally during the VC sessions.
 Registration will close once the target of 100 registers persons has been reached. Those who attempt to register after this will be advised that capacity has been reached and that they can add their name and contact details to a waiting list to be informed of when the service will become available again. This will include basic information only e.g. first name, email, age and gender. These individuals will also offered face to face support by AWARE NI outside of the study. The number of persons registering interest overall will be recorded as a measure of demand for the service and will inform the recruitment strategy of the larger RCT study.
 The registration process will involve completion of several baseline measures including demographic information (first name, date of birth/age, gender, postcode, and information on any services currently receiving or accessed within the last year) and completion of validated measures of health status (see appendix A).
 Randomisation Randomisation will take place following registration and completion of baseline measures (see section below). Each participant will be assigned a unique individual number and a simple random sampling procedure will be performed using online software available at http://www.randomization.com. This will result in approximately 40 participants being invited to join the VC intervention. The decision on this number was based on organisational capacity to deliver VC groups concurrently. The remaining registered participants will act as a waiting list control group (to be offered the intervention at the end of the study). A block randomisation procedure will be applied. This will involve randomly allocating in blocks of size 5 (3 to treatment and 2 to control).
 Data collection Outcome measures will be recorded at baseline, week eight and six months. The research team will explore the appropriateness of the following validated instruments;
 Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), EQ-5D-5L measures of health outcomes and an adapted version of the Client Service Receipt Inventory (CSRI) for economic appraisal. Completion of questionnaires at each stage is expected to take approximately 5-10 minutes in total. These measurements have shown previous validity and reliability in similar studies. Feasibility will be assessed using depression outcomes; ability to recruit and retain; and fidelity (i.e. consistency of implementation across groups). Acceptability will be assessed by comparing attendance across groups, dropout rates and using through the qualitative methods (interviews and observations) specified to explore (1) reasons for taking part; and (2) user satisfaction.
 Next steps
 The study will inform the design and development of a large scale Randomised Controlled Trial to test the effectiveness of conducting a peer led support group intervention for depression in adults using VC technology including: 1. To investigate the effectiveness of VC based support in comparison to face-to-face support for reducing depression in adults 2. To conduct a multi-site economic appraisal of the costs and outcomes of VC support for depression.
 Collaborators at AWARE and project advisors at Mindtech will advise the research team on potential UK partner organisations for the main NETS study. To date, Action on Depression (Scotland) and Depression Alliance (England) have expressed interest and support for the main
 NETS application."

 Targeted, effective behavioral interventions are critically needed to ameliorate the disproportionate prevalence of poor cardiometabolic health for African-American women. We propose a sequential, multiple-assignment, randomized trial targeting physical activity (PA) among at-risk African-American women in resource-limited, Washington, D.C. communities using mobile health (mHealth) technology. We hypothesize that by beginning a community-based, adaptive PA intervention with remote coaching tailored to neighborhood environment PA resources, we will see greater increases in PA levels as compared to standard remote coaching. In Aim 1, we will determine if beginning an adaptive intervention with remote coaching tailored to neighborhood environment resources and delivered using mHealth technology (wearables and mobile applications) will lead to a greater PA increase (as measured by steps per day) as compared to standard remote coaching. In Aim 2, we will examine which of four embedded adaptive interventions produce the largest PA increase over the six-month study period. In Aim 3, we will evaluate the feasibility of remote capture of cardiometabolic measures, including blood pressure, weight, and glucose, using mHealth technology. We will also examine intervention effects on cardiometabolic health (adiposity, blood pressure, fasting lipids/glucose, self-reported PA, dietary intake, cigarette smoking).
 In Aim 4, we will characterize effects of increasing PA on integrated serologic cytokine/chemokine and lipid inflammatory intermediates to identify potential novel inflammatory pathways linked to cardiometabolic risk phenotypes most responsive to the multi-level, community-based PA intervention. We will also determine the feasibility of measuring behavioral and psychosocial mediating factors of the relationship between PA change and cardiometabolic health in this intervention, including chronic psychological/environmental stress and sedentary behavior/sleep. This project provides fundamental knowledge towards the development of tailored, effective behavioral interventions incorporating mHealth technology to promote health among populations most impacted by health disparities."

 Right ventricular (RV) dysfunction is a major risk factor in coronary artery disease (CAD) and patient undergoing revascularization with this combination , incidence of RV dysfunction is reported in about 20% cases of CAD.
 RV dysfunction is a possible cause of cardiac failure after cardiac surgery and has a high mortality rate.
 RV dysfunction is a recognized cause of hypotension early after coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG)
 A decrease in RV function is an event known to occur after CABG. Right ventricular dysfunction can be seen during and immediately after cardiac surgery. Although the mechanism of this phenomenon is not well understood, cardiopulmonary bypass, perioperative myocardial ischemia, intraoperative myocardial damage, cardioplegia, and pericardial disruption or adhesion have been suggested as probable causes.
 Major reasons for complications of cardiac surgery are the need for hypothermic cardiac arrest, aortic cross clamping, and exposure to a cardiopulmonary bypass circuit.
 It has been postulated that avoidance of these factors by performing off-pump coronary artery bypass (OPCAB) surgery might reduce perioperative morbidity and improve outcome.
 Recently, the portion of coronary artery bypass grafting on the beating heart without the use of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) has been expanded in cardiac surgery as a result of awareness of the damaging effect of CPB
 Whether OPCAB surgery can fulfill these expectations, or to which degree, is yet unclear.
 A few studies on hemodynamic alternations associated with OPCAB reported that reduced functions of both ventricles during coronary artery anastomosis are the main mechanism of hemodynamic derangements and especially, impaired diastolic function of the right ventricle (RV) plays an important role
 However, clinical studies evaluating the change in RV function in patients with ischemic heart disease are very rare. It is reported that the major cause of hemodynamic changes during OPCAB was disturbed diastolic filling of the RV through the measurement of chamber pressures or monitoring of echocardiography.
 There was no significant change in the RVEF and cardiac index during anastomosis of the left anterior descending artery and right coronary artery. However, the significantly reduced RVEF accompanied by an increase in RV afterload and decrease in the CO was observed during anastomosis of the obtuse marginal (OM) artery. RV volumes did not significantly change during anastomoses, though the right atrial pressure increased during anastomoses of all coronary arteries. The displacement of beating heart for positioning during anastomosis of the graft to OM artery caused significant derangement of RV function and decrease in CO."

 Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the most common bacterial infections. In 2007, in the
 United States alone, there were an estimated 10.5 million office visits for UTI symptoms (constituting 0.9% of all ambulatory visits) and 2-3 million emergency department visits.
 UTIs are significantly more common in women and are a leading cause of urogynecology referrals. In women, the vagina plays a key role in the pathogenesis of UTIs. The initial step in the pathogenesis of UTI is colonization of the vaginal opening and peri-urethra with uropathogens from the intestinal microbiota, followed by ascension of uropathogens via the urethra to the bladder and sometimes the kidneys to cause infection. Thus, understanding factors that affect the microbiota of the vagina is key to understanding the pathogenesis of
 UTI. Likewise, since Wolfe et al published the first evidence of a urinary microbiome in 2012, there has been growing interest in whether the content of this microbiome could correlate with symptoms of the lower urinary tract. The urinary microbiome has been shown to correlate with symptoms of urgency incontinence but to date, there is no data on whether the composition of the urinary microbiome is associated with any change in risk for UTIs. If the urinary microbiome could play a role in the acquisition of clinical infection, then the factors that affect the microbiome of the bladder would be important in preventing UTIs. One plausible and modifiable factor that may change the vaginal and urinary microbiome is the presence of pubic hair. Hair in other parts of the body (nose, ears, eyebrows) traps and stops the passage of pathogens into our mucous membranes. Additionally, the sebum produced by hair follicles is bacteriostatic. However, some form of pubic hair grooming is performed by the majority of pre-menopausal women (83%) and 62% of women between age 18-40 report having removed ALL of their pubic hair at one point in life. This is predominantly done by using non-electric razors (61%) but other women use lasers, waxing and depilatory creams.
 Fifty-nine percent of women who perform pubic hair removal report their primary reason is to improve hygiene. However, there is no data that this practice changes hygiene, with the exception of preventing pubic hair lice. On the contrary, pubic hair removal has been associated with skin injury leading to inoculation of bacteria and viruses. In a recent cross-sectional study of pubic hair and sexually transmitted infections, researchers found that frequent pubic hair grooming was correlated with a higher risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs). This preliminary work raises the question of whether the presence of pubic hair affects the vaginal or urinary microbiome, thereby changing a woman's risk of infection in either organ. Furthermore, specific pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) including painful bladder syndrome and urgency urinary incontinence have been associated with specific microbiome profiles. Therefore, by falsely attempting to maintain pelvic health through grooming practices, women might inadvertently be exposing themselves to PFDs mediated by changes in their urinary or vaginal microbiomes. The aim of this study is to address this question through a pilot study of urinary and vaginal microbiomes in women with and without pubic hair AND in the same woman with and without pubic hair."

 Cochlear implantation (CI) is a worldwide accepted and effective surgical procedure for patients with profound sensory neural hearing loss to gain near normal hearing.1 The position of electrode inside the cochlea affects the outcomes. Full insertion of the CI electrode array and insertion in scala tympani usually has optimal results and better words recognition.2 Translocation of electrode array from scala tympani to scala vestibule or outword migration of electrode array may result in poor response.2 There are many intraoperative and post operative techniques to determine the position of electrode array inside the cochlea, some are radiological as transorbital view plan x-ray or computed tomography or 3D rotational x ray and others are electrophysiological measurements.3 Although the accuracy of the radiological techinques they are time and cost consuming1. The electrically evoked cochlear action potential (ECAP) threshold is dependent on the distance between the electrodes and the spiral ganglion cells. The neural response telemetry-ratio (NRT-ratio) is one of the electrophysiological measurments techniques and it is based on each individual electrode's ECAP threshold and can identify the intracochlear electrode array position 4. According to a study done by Philipp Mittmann in 2015, a NRT-ratio above 1.05 indicates an electrode translocation from scala tympani to scala vestibuli and a NRT-ratio below 1.05 shows correlation to a pure scala tympani placement5, but another study found variation of the NRT-ratio in a group of patients with an electrode placement within scala tympani.6"

 Objective The overall objective of this project is to investigate longitudinal patterns and consequences of tuberculosis (TB) infection in a prospective cohort of women recruited during pregnancy. The relation between maternal TB infection and pregnancy outcomes, as well as infant health and development, will be evaluated over time.
 Specific aims 1. To determine whether maternal TB infection is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes 2. To determine the excess risk of incident active TB during pregnancy and post-partum, with regard to the prevalence of latent TB infection at registration in antenatal care 3. To investigate long-term health and survival in infants in relation to maternal TB and adverse pregnancy outcomes
 Methods Study setting and participants This project will be conducted in public health facilities in the city of Adama, Central Ethiopia. Participants will be recruited and followed at antenatal care (ANC) clinics until delivery. After delivery their children will be followed at clinics for extended program for immunization (EPI); continued follow-up of the mothers after the first post-natal visit will also take place in these clinics.
 All study procedures, including interviews, physical examination, and collection of informed consent, will be performed by regular health facility staff (nurses and midwives) in the respective clinics. Biological samples including blood and sputum will be collected at the respective health facility laboratory. Study samples will be transported to the Adama
 Regional Laboratory. At this laboratory, additional analyses and storage of plasma will be done.
 For supervision and monitoring of data collection, as well as for data entry, the project will use staff and infrastructure in a field research station which has been established in
 Adama since 2010 by the research group.
 Study procedure Both scheduled and unscheduled study visits can occur for participants in this project. Scheduled study visits coincide with routine antenatal and postnatal visits and visits at the EPI clinics for the infant's immunization following National guidelines.
 Unscheduled visits will occur in case of symptoms suggestive of active TB (according to the study definitions) in the pregnant/postnatal/non-pregnant woman, or in the child, at any time in between these routine visits.
 Antenatal care visits At inclusion, structured information on socio-demographic conditions, education, occupation, and poverty indicators will be collected; as well as medical history (in particular for obstetric, gynecological and TB-related details). Physical and obstetric examination will be performed. Apart from the study procedures and investigations, participants will receive care according to current Ethiopian ANC guidelines.
 At the inclusion visit blood and urine samples will be obtained for routine care and for study specific investigations from all participants. At the health facility laboratory, the following analyses will be performed: HIV rapid test, malaria microscopy and urine dipstick.
 Ten mL of venous blood will be collected. This sample will be used for analysis of complete blood count, blood/Rh group, syphilis serology, creatinine and fasting glucose. The remaining plasma will be aliquoted and stored at -80° C for research analyses that will be performed at the completion of inclusion. Blood will be collected separately for QuantiFERON TB Plus (QFT) testing, in order to determine the prevalence of LTBI. For the last 500 women included in the study, QFT testing will be repeated at the 3rd antenatal care visit. From HIV positive women blood for viral load and CD4 count will be drawn at each scheduled visit pre- and post-delivery except from 2nd and 3rd antenatal care visit.
 Participants will be followed up four times in accordance with WHO recommended focused antenatal visits until delivery or term of pregnancy. They will also be instructed to contact the study clinic in between these visits in case of health-related events. In case of delivery (or other unintended termination of pregnancy) in another place than any of the study health facilities, they will be asked to communicate this to their study site for further follow-up examinations.
 All participants with suspected active TB according to the study definition (irrespective of
 Quantiferon results) at enrolment and/or during follow up will be asked to submit samples for bacteriological TB investigations. These will encompass liquid culture, smear microscopy and
 PCR (using Xpert MTB/RIF technique). All these tests will be performed on two consecutive morning sputum samples. Lymph node aspirates will be obtained from participants with enlarged peripheral lymph nodes. Moreover, acquisition of blood for QuantiFERON testing will be repeated for all women investigated for suspected active TB.
 Stored aliquots of plasma will be analyzed at the end of inclusion for potential blood biomarkers of TB infection during pregnancy. These analyses will be performed using ELISA and/or Luminex technique, and they will include the following markers of immune activation and inflammation: C-reactive protein (CRP), neopterin, soluble urokinase-plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR), interferon-inducible protein 10 (IP-10).
 Postpartum follow-up visits for women Further follow-up visits for women will be scheduled for 6 weeks and 9 months after delivery or termination of pregnancy, coinciding with the routine child visits for immunization. The first postnatal visit will take place at the ANC clinic, whereas all subsequent visits will take place at the respective EPI clinics (where infant follow-up will also occur). At the 6 week postnatal visit details on delivery outcome will be recorded.
 For investigation of long-term health effects after delivery, participants will be asked to come for further annual visits with similar assessments until 54 months after termination of pregnancy. At all follow-up visits symptoms and signs on physical examination will be recorded using structured questionnaires.
 At inclusion, and repeatedly on scheduled follow-up visits, participants will be informed about symptoms and signs that may indicate active TB. Study subjects will be instructed to contact the study site clinic (ANC during antenatal period, EPI during postnatal period) directly if they develop such symptoms for unscheduled study visits (in order to assess incident active TB during follow-up).
 At all visits, whether scheduled or unscheduled, bacteriological testing (smear microscopy,
 Xpert MTB/RIF assay, and liquid culture) will be performed according to the study protocol in case study criteria for suspected active TB are met. These tests will be performed on two morning sputum samples for women; in addition, lymph node aspirates may be sent for TB analysis in case of suspected lymphadenitis.
 In case study participants do not come for their scheduled study visits they will be contacted by phone by the study site staff and/or the research study team. If the participant cannot be reached, her contact person will be contacted by phone. At mid-time in between the scheduled visits, women will be contacted by phone by a member of the local research team to assess whether any health events or symptoms compatible with TB have occurred.
 Follow-up visits for infants If consent has been provided by the mother, infants will be registered and included in a separate infant follow-up cohort as soon as possible after birth. Birth details, including delivery method, weight, length, APGAR score, and head circumference will be registered at inclusion of the infant. Follow-up of included infants will take place in the EPI clinic at the respective study health facilities. Follow-up visits will be scheduled at the same time interval as the mother, i.e. at 6 weeks and 9 months and subsequently at annual intervals congruent with the mothers until four and a half year after birth. The two first visits coincide with routine immunization visits. On all study visits, parameters of growth, nutritional and neurological development will be recorded using structured questionnaires. In addition, data on socio-demographic characteristics, health-related events and feeding details will be recorded, as well as data on known or suspected exposure to TB.
 At inclusion, and repeatedly on scheduled follow-up visits, caretakers will be informed about symptoms and signs that may indicate active pediatric TB. Study infant caretakers will be instructed to contact the study site EPI clinic directly if the infants develop such symptoms for unscheduled study visits (in order to assess incident active TB during follow-up).
 If criteria for suspected TB are met at any time during follow-up bacteriological investigations (liquid culture, PCR and microscopy) will be performed on gastric lavage specimens (or cerebrospinal fluid in case of suspected meningitis; or fine-needle lymph node aspirates in case of peripheral lymphadenopathy). These investigations will be performed by trained health care staff at the Department of Pediatrics, Adama Regional Hospital.
 Stored aliquots of plasma will be analyzed at the end of inclusion for potential blood biomarkers of TB in young children. These analyses will be performed using ELISA and Luminex technique, and they will include the following markers of immune activation and inflammation:
 C-reactive protein (CRP), neopterin, soluble urokinase-plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR).
 In case infant participants do not come for their scheduled study visits their caretakers will be contacted by phone by the study site staff and/or the research study team. If the caretaker cannot be reached, the contact person will be contacted by phone. At mid-time in between the scheduled visits, caretakers will be contacted by phone from a study investigator to assess whether any health events or symptoms compatible with TB have occurred in the infant.

 The investigators propose to perform a preferences survey to be administered to women with ovarian cancer.The investigators anticipate that about 1/3 of the study cohort will include patients who are receiving treatment with an oral ADP-ribose polymerase inhibitors (PARPi).
 The investigators will begin by conducting interviews with 5 pilot subjects as they test the preferences survey. Based on their feedback the survey may be updated for clarity. During the final survey phase, subjects will be recruited and invited to participate in the choice experiment by Biologics, Inc., a specialty pharmacy company that dispenses oral PARPis.
 Subjects may also be recruited through ResearchMatch.org and at the Gynecologic Oncology division at Duke. Up to 300 women may be included in this study, at least 100 women will have received treatment with a PARPi.
 Discrete choice experiment (DCE) questions generate limited dependent-variable, cross-section/time-series data. The study team will use random-parameters logit (RPL) to analyze the choice-format conjoint data collected in the DCE survey. Unobserved variation in preferences across the sample can bias estimates in conventional conditional-logit choice models. RPL avoids this potential bias by estimating a distribution of preferences around each model parameter that accounts for variations among individual preferences not accounted for by the variables in the model. The flexible correlation structure of RPL also accounts for within-sample correlation in the question sequence for each respondent.
 There are no physical risks to subject participation in this survey protocol."

 ICSI is a method used in IVF in which a single sperm is injected directly into an oocyte.
 Originally ICSI was developed as a method for the treatment for couples with severe male factor infertility. In the last decades the use of ICSI has increased dramatically, especially for non-male factor infertility. In certain fertility clinics in the world ICSI is conducted in 100% of IVF cycles.
 Despite the increased use of ICSI, there is no clear evidence that ICIS is more effective than conventional IVF for non-male factor infertility. There are currently few randomized controlled studies that compared the two modalities in the case of non-male factor infertility. In a randomized controlled trial that included 415 couples with non-male factor infertility and women younger than 37 years of age, conventional IVF was associated with better fertilization and implantation rates than ICSI but with comparable live birth rates.
 In addition, studies have not shown an advantage for ICSI over conventional IVF in the case of unexplained infertility, low oocyte yield or routine use to decrease the incidence of fertilization failure.
 The proportion of women after the age of 35 undergoing IVF is constantly on the rise. Oocytes retrieved from older women are often of lower quality then oocytes retrieved from younger women. It is believed that due to the lower quality the fertilization rate is decreased in this population. However a recently published retrospective study including 745 women did not show an advantage for ICSI over conventional IVF. Contrary to what is believed, the conventional IVF group had a higher number of zygotes formed, more cycles with embryos transferred at the blastocyst stage and more cycles where embryos were available for cryopreservation.
 The investigators therefore aim to perform a prospective randomized controlled study to compare between ICSI and conventional IVF in women between 39 to 44 years of age with non-male factor infertility. Male-factor infertility will be diagnosed according to the accepted semen analysis values included a semen concentration of 200 million/mL, progressive motility of 40% and a strict morphology of 4%. Patients will undergo standard clinical and hormonal investigation as usual for IVF. The treatment protocol will be in accordance with the decision of the attending physician, regardless of the research. Randomization will be between the ovaries of each patient. Following an informed consent a computer based randomization will allocate either ICSI or conventional IVF for each ovary so that for each study participant oocyte from one ovary will be randomly allocated to insemination by ICSI and the oocytes from the other ovary will be allocated to insemination by conventional IVF.
 As is customary in our IVF unit, 24, 72 and 96 hours after oocyte retrieval, the embryos will by studied by an embryologist for the number of cells and embryo quality."

 Background: Inability to walk outdoors restricts full participation in physical activity and community living for older adults that can reduce health-related quality of life (HRQL).
 Older adults report limited outdoor walking with only 8% achieving the Canadian recommendation for older adults of 150 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous (MV) intensity physical activity per week. Known barriers to walking outside include fear, physical disability due to chronic disease, the appropriateness of footwear and walking aids, the physical environment, weather and temperature. Group practice walking outdoors in locations with variable environmental challenges has the potential to improve physical ability, confidence, outdoor and overall physical activity and social participation. The extent to which it is safe and feasible to implement this intervention in people with varying degrees of physical ability, preferences for where to walk, neighbourhood walkability, and to measure outdoor walking activity, is unclear.
 Objectives: In older adults with a limitation in outdoor community mobility: 1. To estimate the extent to which a 1-day educational workshop and 3-month outdoor mobility program (GO-OUT intervention) compared to the workshop and weekly reminders improves outdoor walking activity (primary outcome) and secondary outcomes of physical activity, lifespace mobility, participation, HRQL, balance, leg strength, walking self-efficacy, walking speed, walking distance/endurance, and mood over 12 months. 2. To explore participants' perceptions of intended and unintended consequences of the interventions, potent intervention components, mechanisms of effect, modifying influences of disability level, sex,neighbourhood walkability, weather, car access, and study site, and recommendations for future program delivery models.
 Approaches and Methods:Study Design: A 2-group mixed methods stratified randomized controlled trial following CONSORT55 criteria is proposed. Group allocation will be concealed and outcome evaluation blinded. The trial will be run at 4 sites (Edmonton, Winnipeg, Toronto,
 Montreal) to accrue a sufficient sample size, optimize the external validity of the results to urban centres variable in population size, weather conditions, and environmental barriers, and build capacity across 4 provinces to support potential implementation.10 Following a baseline assessment, eligible participants will be stratified by site, and randomly assigned to receive the 1-day educational workshop and 3-month outdoor mobility program (GO-OUT intervention) or the 1-day workshop plus reminders. Follow-up evaluations will occur at 3, 5 and 12 months from baseline. A sub-sample of participants from the GO-OUT and workshop groups at each site will participate in face-to-face interviews at 6 and 12 months to explore their experiences. Interventions and assessments are designed to be implemented in 'good weather' months, to avoid the potential negative effect of season on the primary outcome of outdoor walking activity."

 TYPES OF TISSUES TO BE BANKED
 Blood:
 Blood will be collected from the out-patient clinic, prospectively at the time of a clinically planned procedure or prospectively during a procedure performed solely for research. After informed consent is obtained, the patient/ subject will be asked to donate a one-time blood sample of up to 30ml. A portion of each blood sample will be used to generate a DNA sample, and the remainder will be used to separate out plasma, peripheral blood cells, and/or serum for future research studies, including but not limited to metabolomics, proteomics, biomarker measurements, and bioenergetic assays.
 Cerebrospinal Fluid:
 Cerebrospinal fluid 5-10ml may be collected prospectively from lumbar puncture or the subset of patients who have an external ventricular drain (EVD) placed as part of their clinical care. The standard clinical protocol for EVD includes the drainage of CSF externally into a collection bag. Once the volume of CSF drainage is recorded, the CSF is typically discarded.
 The collection of CSF will be coordinated with the subject's primary treatment team. At this time, CSF banking will not occur in subjects who do not have CSF collection planned as part of their clinical care.
 Body Tissue:
 The body tissue will be collected from the patients who undergo the carotid stent which is their routine medical treatment. Around 5mg tissue will be taken from the filter wire during the stenting operation and then stabilized by RNAlater reagent immediately. The tissue will be kept in -80oC freezer for future process.
 Buccal swab or saliva:
 Buccal swab or saliva ( 5-10ml) may be collected from the patients, their family members and/or normal subjects for DNA and RNA extraction if necessary. It would be collected by the trained doctor, medical staffs or research assistant. The collected samples will be kept in
 -80oC freezer for future use, for example, extraction of DNA."
NCT03300089,223338,2018-10-25T00:00:00Z,Clinical Trial Description,223338,AACT," 1. Background Lumbar spine surgery can be performed using different anaesthetic techniques such as general endotracheal anaesthesia (GA) or spinal-based regional anaesthesia (RA).
 In a recent review several studies showed a decreased postoperative pain score in the RA groups (1). But only few randomized control trials (RCT) have been performed comparing these two anaesthetic techniques and have shown partly conflicting results (2-5).
 Each anaesthetic agent or regimen has a particular side effect profile (e.g. opioids - nausea, vomiting, pruritus, sedation; local anaesthetics - motor weakness) which may affect quality of recovery in different ways. Although there are few data examining the correlation between side effects from different analgesic regimens and quality of recovery per se, some data suggest different analgesic regimens will result in different side effects and consequently different levels of quality of recovery.
 Although inconsistent data exist covering surgery time, anaesthesia time, postoperative anaesthetic care unit (PACU) time and postoperative analgesic dose requirements (6-8).
 But there are some hinds that RA leads to better results concerning postoperative mortality and morbidity in opposite to general anaesthesia (9-10). Also RA showed better results concerning economic aspects (11,12).
 No clinical trials have sufficient subject numbers to determine definitively the effects of anaesthetic techniques on minor or major benefits concerning clinical outcome. There is insufficient evidence to confirm or deny the ability of these two anaesthetic techniques to affect major postoperative mortality or morbidity and there is currently no sufficient evidence that RA or GA have any clinically significant beneficial effect on postoperative outcome. Further there are still insufficient data to determine if the type of anaesthetic technique, degree of analgesia and the presence of side effects may influence quality of life, quality of recovery, patient and surgeon's satisfaction and length of hospitalisation.
 There are few data examining the correlation between side effects from different anaesthetic regimens and quality of recovery per se, some data suggest different analgesic regimens may result in different side effects and consequently different levels of quality of recovery.
 Although there are data suggesting that improved postoperative analgesia leads to better patient outcomes, there is insufficient evidence to support subsequent improvements inpatient-centered outcomes such as quality of life and quality of recovery. So the correlation between RA and different outcome parameters are very complex and up to now there is no clear evidence for any recommendation concerning the use of RA or GA in generally (13). 2. Study Objective Lumbar spine surgery can be performed using different anaesthetic techniques such as general endotracheal anaesthesia (GA) or spinal-based regional anaesthesia (RA). The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of two different anaesthetic techniques and their impact on clinical outcome.
 Further this study is developed to combine validated patient-reported instruments with the assessment of the effect of different anaesthetic techniques on patient-reported outcomes in the peri-and postoperative period. 3. Hypothesis The investigators hypothesize that for patients undergoing lumbar spine surgery, the performing of a RA shows significant benefits in comparison with patients receiving GA. It concerns the postoperative pain score, the degree of PONV, the PACU and anaesthesia time and the patient's and surgeons's satisfaction."

 AgingPLUS is a multi-component intervention program that addresses negative views of aging (NVOA), low internal control beliefs, and deficient goal planning as a risk cluster that keeps adults from engaging in health-promoting behavior. The program focuses on engagement in physical activity (PA) as the health behavior of choice. Engagement in PA is widely recognized as the best non-pharmacological, non-invasive, and cost-effective method of health promotion. Yet, only 20% of the adult population meets the recommended PA guidelines. This suggests that messages about the benefits of PA alone are not effective. Rather, it is essential to address the social-cognitive and motiva-tional mechanisms that prevent adults from adopting and maintaining a regular PA regimen. NVOA, low internal control beliefs, and deficient goal planning represent such a cluster of social-cognitive and motivational mechanisms.
 Given this background, the specific aims and hypotheses of the proposed research are:
 Aim 1: To conduct a randomized controlled trial examining the efficacy of the AgingPLUS program.
 Aim 2: To test a conceptual model of the mechanisms underlying the intervention effects.
 Aim 3: To conduct a 6-month follow-up to examine the longer-term effects of AgingPLUS.
 Upon completion of this project, we expect to have successfully established evidence for the efficacy of the AgingPLUS program (Stage II of the NIH Stage Mode). The long-term goal is to develop AgingPLUS into a full-fledged evidence-based program that can be implemented in community settings (e.g., senior centers), and can serve as a fairly brief and cost-effective public health tool to promote healthy and successful aging."

 Background: Hip External Rotation (HER) exercises are being adopted into physiotherapy practice for the treatment of stress urinary incontinence (SUI) despite little evidence compared to the proven effective standard of care treatment, pelvic floor muscle (PFM) exercises. A randomised clinical trial (RCT) is needed to determine whether HER exercise alone or in combination with PFM is more or less effective than PFM exercises alone.
 Objective: Before designing an RCT, a feasibility study is needed to evaluate the Lois Hole
 Hospital for Women's Urogynecology Clinic's ability to recruit and randomize SUI patients to the proposed RCT, and to test the study procedures and follow-up schedule for participants.
 Interventions: The interventions used in the feasibility study will be training of (1) HER exercises alone, (2) HER exercises in combination with PFM exercises, or (3) PFM exercises alone (control/usual care) in the treatment of SUI.
 Study design: RCT in which participants are randomly allocated 1:1:1 to each intervention.
 Outcome Measures: Feasibility outcomes will pertain to recruitment, adherence to training, appropriateness of outcome measures and completion rates. The design of the proposed RCT will be based on these feasibility outcomes.
 Outcome measures for the proposed RCT will include pelvic floor muscle strength, external hip rotator muscle strength, diary-reported urinary incontinence, incontinence related quality of life, and (to test patient mobility) six minute walk test and timed up and go test.
 Sample size: The proposed sample size is 30 participants. Duration of study: After recruitment, each woman will undergo 12 weeks of training, with the first outcome measure at the end of that period, and a further follow up at 24 weeks from recruitment."

 Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) is a common complaint in women after childbirth. It affects their quality of life and sexual satisfaction and is one of the major reasons for gynaecological surgery. There is a need for effective non-invasive treatment alternatives.
 The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of non-ablative Er:YAG laser therapy in the treatment of SUI and improvement of sexual gratification in parous women. 114 premenopausal parous women with SUI were randomized in two groups of 57 women; a laser intervention group and sham control (placebo) group. Both groups were treated according to the IncontiLaseTM clinical treatment protocol for SUI with non-ablative thermal-only Er:YAG laser, except that there was no energy output when treating the sham group. Patients were blinded to the allocation. At baseline and 3 months after treatment patients were clinically examined, answered questionnaires for SUI severity sexual function assessment and their pelvic floor muscle (PFM) function was assessed with perineometry. Validated International
 Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire - Urinary Incontinence Short Form (ICIQ-UI SF) was used as the primary outcome measure. The Pelvic Organ Prolapse Urinary Incontinence Sexual
 Questionnaire short form (PISQ-12) and The Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) were used to assess the sexual function. Patients were monitored for discomfort and side-effects during treatment and follow up period."

 Study Rationale Ureteroscopy is a widely performed procedure in urology. Pain is one of the commonest complications after ureteroscopy and one of the common reasons for re-admission after this procedure. Insertion of a stent post-ureteroscopy can cause pain affecting daily activities in 80% of the patients. Pain post ureteroscopy is multi-factorial and currently there is no specific method used clinically to treat this. Intraluminal injection of local anesthetic solution in the ureter has been extensively studied in the animal model with positive results. Intraluminal injection steroids has also been studied previously and steroids have also been used in medical expulsive therapy for ureteric stones previously. The investigators are proposing the use of high concentration alkalinized long-acting local anaesthetic levo-bupivicaine and long-acting steroid dexamethasone for post-ureteroscopy pain. It is simple, cheap, safe, easy to perform and widely available.
 Background Intraluminal injection of local anesthetics (LA) in the ureter has been studied previously in animal models. Burdgya et al in 1986, USSR examined effects of LA on guinea pig ureters . Action potential of ureteric smooth muscle has initial fast component consisting of repeated gradually decaying spikes and a subsequent slow component i.e plateau. This action potential is accompanied by a brief contraction. Two opposite effects of LA occur on ureteric smooth muscle: Low concentrations of procaine, lignocaine and tetracaine (0.1-1 mM) at pH 7.4 increased duration of slow plateau of the evoked action potentials. At higher concentrations lignocaine (5mM) and tetracaine (0.5mM) caused complete inhibition of evoked action potentials and phasic contractions. Procaine 5mM predominantly inhibited contractile responses. High pH (9) significantly increased while low pH (pH 6) decreased the inhibitory action of procaine and lignocaine. Tetracaine had the most potent inhibitory action on ureter smooth muscle with the weakest stimulant action while lignocaine had stronger inhibitory effect on ureter smooth muscle than procaine. Ross et al in 1972 reported intraluminal injection of 2% lignocaine reduced peristaltic activity in 5 out of 15 ureters in their patients with no effect in the remaining group.
 Andersson and Ulmsten found that local instillation of 4% lignocaine in their patients caused an initial brief stimulation followed by reduced activity. Tsuchida in 197 studied dog ureters to report prompt inhibitory effect of 4% lignocaine applied to mucosa invivo with no effect when applied to adventitia.
 Struthers in 1976 in his invivo dog studies found both systemic and intraluminal administration of lignocaine, procaine and mepivacaine caused only hyperperistalsis and never inhibition. Sur et al published a study with intravesical injection of ropivacaine before ureteroscopic surgery demonstrated trends toward decreased pain and voiding symptoms.
 Patients received five injections of 2 mL 0.5% ropivacaine around the ureteral orifice or to the control cohort, who received five injections of 2 mL of 0.9% normal saline in identical locations. A pilot study suggested that PSD597 (intravesical alkalinized lidocaine) is effective for treating interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome (IC/PBlS) , providing short-term amelioration of symptoms in a substantial proportion of patients, with a strong suggestion that repeating the treatment has a potentially cumulative effect. A randomized controlled trial comparing injection of non-irritating salt water (placebo), and half an injection of pH buffered lidocaine before the stent placement in patients undergoing ureteroscopy is currently being conducted. Till date there is no human study assessing the efficacy and safety of high concentration alkalinised long-acting LA injection for post-ureteroscopy pain based on the results of the animal studies outlined above.
 The anaesthetic drug chosen for this study is levobupivacaine (Chirocaine™ -): it is S-isomer of bupivacaine, an amino-amide local anaesthetic widely used in regional anaesthesia, in postoperative analgesia and in treatment of acute and chronic pain. This drug produces sensory and motor nerve conduction block, acting on sodium channels of the cell membrane - sensitive to electric stimulus - but also on potassium and calcium channels. Moreover, it is remarkable for a rapid onset time and a long duration. In vitro and in vivo pharmacodynamic studies show that levobupivacaine has the same potency as bupivacaine, though the former is less likely to cause cardio- and neurotoxicity.
 The effect of steroids on ureteric motility has previously been studied in in-vitro sheep models. Glucocorticoids inhibit the release of phospholipase A2 enzyme which catalyses the release of arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids and thereby can have a spasmolytic action on the ureter by a prostaglandin-inhibitory action. Dexamethasone has shown the most potent dose dependant effect on the ureteral motility, it blocks ureteral motility in high concentrations within 24 minutes of instillation. Being a long-acting steroid, its duration of action in previous studies on nerve blocks and intra-articular injections is demonstrated at 12 weeks.
 Study population: 150 patients undergoing ureteroscopy for ureteric stones: 1. Ureteric stone treatment (including proximal, mid and distal ureteric stones) with or without JJ stent insertion OR 2. Negative ureteroscopy (no stone found)
 Pre and intraop: Obtain informed written consent pre-operatively with a pre-operative pain score, and rule out any allergies. Standardised uniform anesthetic regimen in all ureteroscopies.Post-ureteroscopy: drain the renal pelvis"

 Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) is a personalized form of immunotherapy, where lymphocytes isolated from the patient's own tumor tissue are expanded 1000-fold ex-vivo and then infused back into the patient. The lymphocytes are then able to recognize and attack remaining cancer cells. This approach has shown remarkable clinical results in several trials conducted worldwide for patients with advanced melanoma - some with durable remissions. Promising clinical results were obtained in smaller trials where patients with disparate solid tumors were treated with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). At Center for Cancer Immune Therapy (CCIT) at Herlev Hospital, there are currently clinical trials undergoing in ovarian and renal cancer, and internationally ACT is being tested in an increasing number of cancer diagnoses, some trials are even recruiting patients across cancer types. Studies have shown that a high intratumoral infiltration with TILs in is correlated to the general clinical outcome of the disease in virtually all solid tumors, and thus clinical trials with TIL-based
 ACT to different cancer diagnoses have been undertaken.
 To support the TIL-mediated tumor elimination, in classical ACT protocols patients go through a highly specialized treatment regime before and after TIL infusion. This regime includes lymphodepletion with 7 days non-myeloablative chemotherapy, to provide an immunological window of opportunity for the infused TILs, and concomitant immune stimulation with interleukin-2 (IL-2). Checkpoint inhibition to support the anti-tumor activity of TILs is currently under extensive investigation in several other trials worldwide. Thus, lymphodepletion and IL-2 stimulation are well-established as supportive therapy and already an integrated part of current ACT protocols and while checkpoint inhibition is a new addition at CCIT; internationally other centers have ongoing comparable trials.
 Drug-based immunotherapy in the form of checkpoint inhibitors (anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4) has yielded impressive clinical results across tumor histologies. Recent results indicate that the effect of immunotherapy relies not so much on the cancer diagnoses but rather on the genomic and immunologic features of the individual patient's cancer disease. Both ACT and checkpoint inhibition work by tipping the immunological balance in favor of activation and away from suppression or avoidance by the cancer cells. Scientific evidence now show that administering anti-CTLA-4 and PD-1 could provide a benefit in the ACT setting, and several ongoing clinical trials are testing combinations of ACT and checkpoint inhibition. To synergistically maximize the immunological potential, we wish to combine ACT with an anti-CTLA-4 antibody (Ipilimumab) prior to tumor resection and an anti-PD-1 antibody (Nivolumab) in combination with TIL infusion.
 Patients will be treated with one dose of Ipilimumab 14 days before undergoing surgery to harvest tumor material for TIL production. Patients is admitted on day -8 in order to undergo lymphodepleting chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and fludara starting day -7. On day -2 patients will start treatment with Nivolumab every 2 weeks for a total of 4 doses to increase the activity of the infused TIL product.
 Available evidence indicates that ACT is a safe and feasible treatment option in an increasing number of solid tumors, and that it should be tested in all cancer patients regardless of their cancer diagnosis."

 Cystic echincoccosis (CE), caused by infection with the dog tapeworm, is a major worldwide healthcare problem with increasing prevalence in the developed world. Approximately 75% of CE involves the liver, with treatments incurring significant cost and patient morbidity.
 The key to CE treatment is correct identification of active infection but differentiation from sterile disease is highly problematic. Current treatment guidelines base activity assessment on morphological assessment with ultrasound (US), serology and light-microscopy of samples obtained at aspiration/surgery when available. Serology however can take many years to become negative even following successful treatment and US evaluation is subjective.
 Assessment of disease 'activity' is therefore a major challenge, particularly once patients are undergoing treatment. The lack of accurate tools to assess treatment response has undermined the development of management guidelines, particularly concerning the optimum length of chemotherapy treatment and indications for surgical/image-guided intervention.
 Quantitative MR methods present a potential solution to this challenge. Magnetic Resonance
 Spectroscopy (MRS) has shown promising ex vivo results in detecting the biochemical signature of active infection in cyst fluid, but has yet to be applied clinically.
 Alternative approaches including T1 mapping, susceptibility mapping and Diffusion Weighted
 Imaging/Intra-voxel Incoherent Motion are also potentially useful, but have little supportive data to date.
 Non-invasive biomarkers of CE activity are therefore essential to defining specific treatment endpoints, particularly in the context of chemotherapy. Multiple quantitative MR methods could be used to develop composite biomarkers for disease activity. Identifying a new quantitative radiological 'fingerprint' for each stage of the natural life-cycle of hepatic
 CE will enable improved diagnosis and therapeutic triage.
 To date, in vivo liver quantitative MRI has not yet been applied to this cohort of patients, thus representing a novel application of this technology to address an important clinical question.
 With this pilot study, the investigators aim to demonstrate the potential of quantitative MRI methods in the assessment of active/inactive hepatic CE."

 Osteoporotic fragility fractures of the hip are common in the geriatric population, are increasing in frequency, and represent a growing social and economic burden. Pain control after surgical treatment is an area of growing interest, as improvement in post-injury pain is often an important indication for surgical treatment of hip fractures.
 Typically a mainstay of post-operative pain control, the use of opiates has come under increasing scrutiny, as it has been shown to be associated with delirium, respiratory depression, and even may even lead to addiction or abuse in the medically frail geriatric population. These concerns have led to efforts to minimize the use of post-operative opiates in hip fracture patients. In that context, a treatment that could reduce the necessity of post-op narcotics while still improving pain control would be potentially valuable.
 There has been growing interest in the use of long-acting local anesthetics for improving pain control in orthopaedics, particularly in the elective total joint arthroplasty population. Studies have shown that arthroplasty patients receiving long-acting local anesthetics have decreased opiate requirements, reduced length of stay, and lower costs.
 Although well-demonstrated in the elective arthroplasty population, the effects of long-acting local anesthetics have yet to be demonstrated in the hip fracture population.
 Given that these fractures frequently occur in medically frail patients with multiple comorbidities, in whom post-operative confusion and delirium are relatively common, there is the potential for treatments that decrease opiate requirements to demonstrate substantial medical and economic benefits.
 Exparel (liposomal bupivacaine) and long-acting local anesthetics have been used extensively in hip replacement surgery and have not been shown to be associated with any increased risks.
 In the case of patients with displaced femoral neck fractures treated with arthroplasty, the surgical techniques are identical to those being used in this study. Exparel has also been used in trauma surgery as well as foot and ankle surgery without any increased described risks, although its use explicitly in hip fractures has not been published. However, the PI has trained in other medical centers where Exparel is routinely used in hip fracture patients without any identified increased risks or complications, but there is a paucity of data on this subject, which is the rationale for this study.
 The investigators hypothesize that in patients with osteoporotic fragility fractures of the hip, patients receiving intraoperative long-acting local anesthetics will have decreased pain and decreased post-operative opiate requirements, leading to less delirium and decreased hospital resource utilization during their index hospitalization.
 The goal is to conduct a multi-center prospective randomized control trial to determine if liposomal bupivacaine is superior to standard of care by addressing the below separate but related aims: 1. Determine the effectiveness of Exparel to reduce narcotic requirements and pain post operatively after hip fracture treatment. Excess narcotic use in the elderly population is associated with a host of complications often magnified by polypharmacy, including in hospital delirium, increased length of stay, nausea, constipation, urinary retention, respiratory depression and others. Decreasing narcotic usage in this group of patients following hip fracture can possibly reduce such complications. Patients will receive standard of care medical treatment and be randomized to intra-operative Exparel vs. placebo injections. Opioid requirements, complications, pain score, and length of stay will be assessed in the post-operative period. Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that total morphine requirements and pain scores will be decreased in this group following the administration of exparel in the geriatric hip fracture fracture population. 2. Determine the effectiveness of Exparel to reduce delirium in post-operative hip fracture patients. In hospital delirium in elderly patients is associated with poor outcomes, including prolonged length of stay, poor participation in rehabilitation, and falls. Use of a locally administered liposomal bupivacaine could decrease the need for additional medications for pain control in addition to decreased mental stress for patients in this unfamiliar situation, thus resulting in decreased episodes of delirium. The investigators will assess delirium utilizing Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) scores in the post-operative period at regularly scheduled intervals and compare average scores between the treatment / standard of care group. Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that total episodes of delirium will be decreased in the liposomal bupivacaine group. 3. Determine if Exparel is cost-effective in hip fracture patients. The costs associated with increased narcotic usage, prolonged stay, resources, and complications can be significant. The use of liposomal bupivacaine may lead to decreased resource utilization to care for hip fractures. The investigators will conduct an economic analysis evaluating total inpatient hospitalization costs including costs associated with length of stay, medication requirements, and resources associated with consultations and diagnostic evaluations. These costs will be compared against the cost of Exparel administration to evaluate the net cost effect of the intervention. Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that the net cost of inpatient care will be decreased when compared to standard of care."

 Background Surgical site infections According to a Clean Care is safer programme by World
 Health Organization(WHO), the second most frequent and surveyed health care-associated infections in high-income countries is surgical site infections (SSI). The highest SSI is the colorectal surgery with 9.5% interlude per operations. SSI develop negative influence on patient outcome, such as burden the morbidity, mortality and extra expenses to health care system. The length of stay increased 9.7 days due to SSI in 2005 in USA, and more expenses spend on the antibiotics and the advanced dressing materials. Patient suffered from SSI will double the mortality rate in USA with increased cost and readmission for the treatment.
 Modern dressing There are many different treatment and dressing options for health care providers for wound care. The dressings with advanced technology become more popular in recent days. Many studies show the importance of moist wound dressing to enhance the wound healing process. It can provide a moist wound environment, absorb the excess exudate, move away the microorganism and prevent their replication, and provide a barrier from the external environment than the conventional gauze dressing. Besides, a recommendation from the UK's
 National Institution for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) suggest that all surgical incision wound should be dressed with low-adhesive dressing for at least 3-5 days after operation. And a journal published in CINAHL Information System stated that the use of dressing with moist wound healing effects can help to reduce the SSI rate by 50% that the conventional gauze. On the other hand, there are studies commended that there are no significant different in prevention of SSI with the use of moist wound dressing. Therefore, it is a controversial issue on the effectiveness of preventing SSI by using moist wound dressing versus conventional gauze dressing.
 Ionic silver-containing dressing Ionic silver (Ag+), is an active state silver oxidized biologically, is proved as a broad spectrum antimicrobial agent that is effective against aerobic, anaerobic, Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, as well as fungi, viruses, and yeast with minimal development of bacterial resistance. Silver is used commonly in many dressings for the antimicrobial effect. Silver containing dressing can reduce the inflammation of wounds and promotes healing, since silver cations in the dressing can destroy microorganism by inactivating bacterial enzymes, disrupting the functions of cell membrane and binding the bacterial DNA/RNA to cause cell death and inhibiting cell replication.
 Abdominal Colorectal surgery and ionic silver-containing dressing in Hong Kong In Hong Kong, colorectal cancer is the commonest cancer, there were around 5000 new cases in 2014. And it is the second leading cause of cancer deaths, in 2015, around colorectal cancer caused 2000 deaths. An unpublished internal audit carried out in surgical department in Princess Margaret
 Hospital (PMH) in 2015 found that the day 30 post-operation SSI incidence among patients with colorectal surgery using occlusive ionic silver-containing dressing (20%; 19/95) was statistically lower than those using conventional gauze dressing (52.9%; 9/17) with p=0.012 (Table 1). Although the effect of using silver dressing to reduce SSI rate is controversial, there are no formal study has been published locally. Therefore, it is meaningful to carry out a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to prove the significance of silver dressing in reduce SSI rate.
 Objective To compare the SSI incidence among patients with abdominal colorectal surgery patients using prophylactic occlusive ionic silver-containing dressing and conventional gauze dressing."

 Sleep disturbance is commonly found in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and is often accompanied with family distress. Disturbed sleep may exacerbate the core symptoms of
 ASD including stereotypic behaviors, social interactions, and health problems. Therefore, it is important to develop effective intervention strategies to ameliorate the sleep disturbance in children with ASD. Traditionally, behavioral interventions and supplemental melatonin medication are used to improve their sleep quality. However, poor sustainability of behavioral intervention effects and use of other medications (e.g. antidepressants and stimulants) that metabolize melatonin may degrade the effectiveness of these interventions.
 Alternatively, previous research supported physical activity intervention as an effective treatment on sleep disturbance for typically developing children who suffered from sleep disturbance. It is therefore natural to extend the study to examine whether such intervention is also effective in children with ASD. This study aims to investigate whether physical activity intervention would be effective to improve sleep quality in children with ASD.
 Moreover, how physical activity impacts on sleep in children with ASD through melatonin-mediated mechanism model will also be investigated. According to this mechanism model, it is suggested that physical activity could affect circadian rhythm through altering melatonin level. Melatonin is generally lower in ASD children than in their typically developing counterparts and supplemental melatonin medication is often used to treat the sleep disturbance in this population. This study is a parallel-group randomized controlled trial comparing a 12-week jogging intervention and a control group receiving standard care in 32 children with ASD. The changes of four sleep parameters (sleep onset latency; sleep efficiency, wake after sleep onset and sleep duration) through objective actigraphic assessment and parental sleep logs will be monitored. To measure melatonin level, all participants will be instructed to collect a 24-h urinary sample. 6-sulfatoxymelatonin, a creatinine-adjusted morning urinary melatonin and representative for melatonin level, will be measured from the collected urine sample. All the assessments will be carried out before the intervention (T1), immediately after the 12 weeks of physical activity intervention or regular treatment (T2), and 12 weeks after post-intervention (T3) for examination of sustained intervention effect. The findings of this proposed study can provide information on the mechanism pathway that physical activity impacts on sleep in children with ASD, which will contribute to the design of an effective intervention to improve sleep quality for children with ASD."

 It is generally agreed that children with CP reach their gross motor potential by the age of 3.5-5 and a child or young person over the age of 5 years will not improve their GMFCS level.
 BoNT-A is an important treatment in children with CP because it is safe in young children and allows combined treatment. The reduction in muscle tone by this selective treatment provides an opportunity to allow and optimize the effects of other treatments including orthoses, casting, conventional therapies and activity based functional trainings. For this reason,
 BoNT-A injections are always combined with other therapies in Kocaeli University Department of PMR and Izmit Rehabilitation Center. Adjunctive treatments in this department consists of serial casting, orthotics, physical therapy, occupational therapy, cognitive rehabilitation, special educational programs, non invasive brain stimulation with transcranial direct current, neurofeedback, biofeedback, electrical stimulation and other physical therapy modalities, activity based models including functional ambulatory training, constraint induced therapy, bilateral therapy, hippotherapy, music therapy by singing or playing percussive instruments or moving and dancing to music, and robotic rehabilitation.

 The purpose of this study is to determine if CES is a reasonable first line alternative to the current standard of care (SOC) which relies on the use of trazodone for patients with subacute stroke. This objective will be answered by addressing the following:
 • Specific Aim 1: To determine if stroke patients with insomnia who receive CES treatment sleep more hours than stroke patients treated with sham CES.
 Hypothesis: Stroke patients with insomnia who are treated with CES will accumulate more sleeping hours than patients who are treated with sham CES.
 • Specific Aim 2: To determine if stroke patients with insomnia who receive CES treatment have better sleep efficiency than stroke patients treated with sham CES.
 Hypothesis: Stroke patients with insomnia who are treated with CES will demonstrate significantly better sleep efficiency than stroke patients treated with shame CES.
 Our study will take place at Zale Lipshy Hospital in Dallas, TX. The study will enroll 85 stroke patients who score 7 or higher on the Insomnia Severity Scale. Patients will be randomized to a control group or CES treatment group. Patients will receive CES or sham CES for 7 days after a 24-hour washout period. Objective and subjective sleep assessments will be conducted daily during the 7-day study period. Endpoints will be total time spent sleeping, sleep efficiency and daytime drowsiness.
 The known risks of CES are minimal and mild in nature. They include potential for headache, irritation at the site of electrode placement and dizziness. These adverse reactions are rare and in most cases there are no immediate or delayed side effects.
 This randomized controlled trial is designed to meet two study objectives related to quality of sleep and daytime drowsiness.
 Demographic data will be collected from the hospital record and will include age, gender, type of stroke, self-reported history of insomnia or other sleep disorder, prior use of sleep medications, in-hospital use of sleep medications, co-morbid medical conditions.
 Patients admitted to inpatient rehabilitation (IPR) who consent to the study will undergo an overnight washout period before initiation of CES or sham treatment. This allows for any sleep medication they might have received while in acute care to be metabolized and leave their system. On their admission day, day 0 (d0) patients will be asked if they want to participate in our study. If they choose to participate and meet medical inclusion criteria, they will be tested with ISI. Patients who meet the full criteria will not receive sleep medication or CES on their first night.
 The study will begin on day 1 (d1) with the patient receiving 20 minutes of CES/sCES in the morning. This time will be distraction free without the entrance of laboratory technicians, nurses, housekeeping or other staff members. When this period is complete, they will participate in usual care. At midday they will be asked to complete the Karolinska Sleepiness
 Scale (KSS). Between the hours of 6pm and 8pm, they will receive their second daily treatment with CES/sCES in a distraction free environment. The patient will wear the actigraph throughout the study. This procedure will be repeated for 7 treatment days. All procedures will be carried out by research team members or a trained nurse.
 The intensity of the CES will begin on setting 2, standard setting recommended by the device manufacturer, and the patient will have the option to increase the intensity to setting 3 on the second treatment day if they feel they did not receive any benefit from the device.
 If the patient does not feel they are getting adequate sleep the patient may choose to opt out of CES/sCES treatment and receive the standard of care medication for the remainder of the study. Patients who choose the SOC rescue will continue to be monitored with the actigraph. A patient may choose to leave the study at any time.
 We will collect information on side effects for the CES treatment during the 7 days of the study.
 Methods of assigning patients to treatment groups and blinding Patients will be randomized to the active or sham treatment group using an online randomizer, Research randomizer (www.randomizer.org). A list of random numbers will be generated prior to the study. Patients will be assigned a random number in the order that the generator produces. All even patients will be assigned to the control group; odd numbered patients will be assigned to the treatment group.
 Procedural responsibilities and oversight Nursing staff will be educated how to administer the CES and asked to help distribute and collect the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale questionnaire. Photos of proper placement and instructions will be posted in subjects' rooms for reference. Researchers affiliated with this project will apply and remove the actigraph watches and be responsible for data acquisition, cleaning and charging of the devices.
 Researchers affiliated with the study will be responsible for ensuring CES is delivered to the appropriate patients on the days required per protocol.
 We will use verbal recruitment process for the study. The attending and resident physicians will be educated about the study and asked to identity patients who may be appropriate. A member of the research team will explain the risks, benefits and rationale for the study to patients who meet inclusion criteria. Patients will be enrolled when they arrive on the rehabilitation floor if they choose to participate. Consent will be attained via a written document in the subject's primary language (English or Spanish).
 The research team will protect subjects' privacy by conducting all study related verbal interactions with the subject in a closed room, such as the patient's room. For confidentiality, each subject screened will be assigned a unique identification number (ID#).
 Subjects will only be identified by the unique ID # in the data. No demographic data or personal information will be used to identify subjects. This unique ID# will be linked to subject name and will be kept in a locked file cabinet, accessible only to the research team.
 Only the research team will have access to the data. All data for presentations and publications will be reported as mean ± standard error of means. Investigators will educate faculty and residents on each floor about the study to maintain privacy and compliance.
 Sample size was calculated based on several studies that measured the number of hours that subacute rehabilitation patients sleep in an inpatient hospital setting. Alpha levels for error probability were set at .05 for a two-tailed test with 80% power to detect a difference between means of control group compared to CES treatment group.
 Descriptive statistics will be used to determine differences between CES and sCES treatment groups. A T-test will be used to determine if sleep time means differ between groups (p≤
 .05). A chi square analysis will be used to compare data collected from the Karolinska
 Sleepiness Scale. A non-parametric test will be used if data is not able to demonstrate normal distribution."

 Phagenyx® Catheter placed prior to randomization, and will receive either an active treatment of Pharyngeal Electrical Stimulation (PES) or a sham treatment performed by a health care professional (HCP) that is un-blinded to treatment assignment. All other speech pathology standard dysphagia care will be provided by a speech language pathologist (SLP) that is blinded to treatment assignment. Administration of all protocol-specific assessments will be conducted by personnel blinded to treatment assignment.
 The study will follow an adaptive group sequential design with unblinded sample size re-assessment. To ensure 180 evaluable patients with 7-day data and assuming a 20% dropout rate, 225 patients will be enrolled initially. An interim analysis for futility will occur after the first 60 patients complete their 7-day visits and another interim analysis will be performed for efficacy and futility after 120 patients complete their 7-day visits. The total sample size may be increased up to 338 patients after the second interim analysis to ensure up to 270 evaluable patients. Up to 15 investigational centers across the US and possibly
 Europe will participate in this study. The enrollment period is expected to be approximately 24 months and patient participation will last for approximately 11 weeks. Patients will be assessed at the following intervals: baseline, 48 hours, 7 days, 14 days or at discharge, whichever is first, and 11 weeks after completion of the study treatments."

 This will be a prospective study, assessing the safety and effectiveness of intratumoral alpha radiation mediated treatment with Alpha DaRT seeds for the treatment of Skin Squamous
 Cell Carcinoma (SCC) tumors.
 Treatment will be delivered through radioactive sources (Alpha DaRT seeds) inserted into the tumors in the skin. This approach combines the advantages of local intratumoral irradiation of the tumor, as used in conventional brachytherapy, with the power of the alpha radiation emitting atoms, that will be introduced in quantities considerably lower than radiation therapy already used in patients.
 Lesions with histopathological diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma will be studied.

 Most men with fatal prostate cancer develop bone metastases and bone is often the dominant or the only site of metastatic disease. Bone metastases are an important cause of morbidity since they are associated with skeletal related events (SREs) including pathologic fractures, spinal cord compression, and need for surgery or radiation therapy to bone.
 Osteoclast-mediated bone destruction is the key pathologic mechanism for SREs in prostate cancer and other malignancies. Zoledronic acid (ZA) is a potent inhibitors of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. ZA has demonstrated to be effective in preventing SREs in patients with castrate resistant disease; however, its efficacy in hormone naïve disease is uncertain.
 In the last few years new drugs targeting directly the androgen receptor such as Enzalutamide have shown to be very effective in terms of survival prolongation in the management of castration resistant disease and the efficacy in hormone naïve patients is currently under investigation. Interestingly, the results of a large scale, prospective, randomized clinical trial have shown that Enzalutamide administration is also associated with a reduction in the risk of SREs and this raises the question of the usefulness of the addition of bone resorption inhibitors to Enzalutamide.
 The evaluation of bone response of antineoplastic therapies has always been difficult in metastatic bone prostate cancer patients due to their osteoblastic nature. Whole body diffusion-weighted (DW) MRI has been recently proposed as new imaging tool for grading treatment response in patients with skeletal metastases from prostate cancer. According to the literature data DW images can allow the identification of bone marrow infiltration and tumor necrosis induced by treatment. In addition, this technique allows to monitor the bone marrow restoration. This, this technique was selected to evaluate bone response in metastatic prostate cancer patients treated with Enzalutamide with or without Zoledronic Acid in combination with LHRH-A.
 Moreover, since androgen-receptor isoform encoded by splice variant 7 (AR-V7) is an androgens' receptor variant that could have a potential clinical utility as a prognostic factor and predictive marker of therapy response, an ancillary study will be conducted to evaluate ARV7 expression in Circulating Tumor Cells (CTC)."

 Women who have undergone menopause almost ubiquitously experience pelvic complaints at some point in the postmenopausal period. This is most commonly vaginal dryness and discomfort during sexual intercourse. From previous studies, we know that as estrogen levels decrease in menopause, changes occur in the local urogenital tract that include thinning of the vaginal epithelium, an increase in pH and an alteration of the composition of the local bacterial community, including a decrease in the typically predominant species of bacteria lactobacilli. In conjunction with declining estrogen levels, a subset of postmenopausal women experience bothersome lower urinary tract symptoms such as burning with urination, urinary urgency, incontinence and recurrent urinary tract infections. These symptoms are commonly underreported, under-treated, and have been associated with reduced quality of life and decreased productivity in menopause. Genitourinary Syndrome of Menopause (GSM) is a term adapted to be more inclusive of these lower urinary tract symptoms in an effort to reduce delays in evaluation and treatment. It remains controversial whether these symptoms relate directly to estrogen deprivation or are part of the natural aging process. Mainstay therapy includes vaginal lubricants and local estrogen therapy. Though treatment with local estrogen improves both vaginal dryness as well as urinary symptoms, the mechanism is not well understood.
 Additionally, there is a subset of women who do not respond to estrogen treatment or have contraindications to estrogen use. Recent research efforts have been exploring the potential role that the microbiome may play in female pelvic discomfort and dysfunction. Unlike the vagina, the bladder has historically been considered to be a sterile environment, with the presence of bacteria implying infection. However, recent research has helped to elucidate that, similar to the skin, vagina and gastrointestinal tract, a resident microbial community or microbiome exists within the female bladder. Disturbances in the urinary microbial community have been correlated with conditions such as painful bladder syndrome, overactive bladder and urge urinary incontinence. These conditions have considerable symptom overlap with those seen in postmenopausal women who are experiencing GSM and may be considered to be on the same continuum.
 Though microbiome research over the last decade has accelerated our understanding of the role that organisms play in health and disease, the urinary microbiome remains poorly defined.
 Data from ongoing research suggests that the urinary microbiome of pre- and postmenopausal women differ, which would suggest that hormone status may play a role in maintaining the microbial milieu. This research has helped us to better understand how the urinary microbiome varies under normal conditions. In order to better understand the role that estrogen plays in maintaining the bladder and vaginal flora, this study aims to characterize the effect of local estrogen on the urinary and vaginal microbiomes (together termed the urogenital microbiome) in postmenopausal women."

 Early administration of antimicrobials remains the mainstay of treatment of severe infections. Current guidelines of management of severe sepsis suggest that initial therapy of a patient should be reviewed after 48 to 72 hours. At that stage some patients are doing well, whereas others fail to respond. When microbiology cultures of biological specimens fail to provide information for the microbial cause of an infection and susceptibilities to antimicrobials, antimicrobial stewardship relies on the use of biomarkers and mainly procalcitonin (PCT). Data so far, suggest that early changes of serum PCT can inform about the prognosis of the septic patient, with greater values reflecting a worse outcome and higher mortality and that serial measurements within 48-72 hours provide adequate information of the appropriateness of the administered antimicrobials. Moreover the use of a procalcitonin guided-treatment in surgical as well as in non-surgical critically-ill patients, is seen to be non-inferior to the standard antibiotic approach and leads to a shorter antibiotic exposure, having possible beneficial effect on reducing microbial resistance and therapy costs.
 In the largest study conducted so far, de Jong et al showed that PCT-guided stop of treatment was not only safe compared with standard of care antibiotic duration, but also led to a better outcome i.e. significant decrease of both 28-day and 1-year mortality. The results of this study are a major contribution in the field of critical care since they prove for the first time that PCT guidance of antimicrobial treatment allows not only proper antimicrobial stewardship but it is also associated with survival benefit. However, de Jong et al did not provide findings to explain the underlying mechanism of survival benefit. As a rule critically ill patients run two major risks coming from the long-term administration of antimicrobials; the first is infections by Clostridium difficile coming from the ecological damage of gut flora and the second is the risk of infections by multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria colonizing the gut. MDR is emerging after the ecological pressure of broad-spectrum antimicrobial usually administered to the critically ill patient."

 Few clinical studies have evaluated the role of anti-EGFR therapy rechallenge in metastatic colorectal cancer patients and there is no prospective clinical trial assessing the activity of treatment rechallenge with panitumumab-based therapy after initial progression. This study aims at exploring the concept of evolution and expansion of RAS wild type clones in order to restore sensitivity of the tumor to prior anti-EGFR therapy after a time interval in which a different, non-anti-EGFR second-line therapy is administered. Based on aforementioned data, it is hypothesized that rescue through rechallenge with panitumumab-based third-line therapy combined with chemotherapy could be associated with further response and clinical benefit. A significant component of the proposed prospective trial is exploratory translational: cell free plasma and platelet-based genotyping for genetic mutations in different time points will be undertaken in order to study the genetic composition of the metastatic tumour at initiation of and at progression through, anti-EGFR rechallenge therapy.
 Primary endpoint will be to evaluate the efficacy, in terms of overall response rate, of the addition of panitumumab rechallenge to standard third-line irinotecan-based or oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer initially treated with, and benefiting from, first line irinotecan-based or oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy combined with an anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody, followed by second line chemotherapy not containing anti-EGFR agents.

 Vitamin D is important risk factor for developing multiple sclerosis (MS) and for disease progression. Patients with MS who had lower vitamin D levels were at increased risk for more clinical attacks and faster disease progression. It was also shown that patients with MS had lower vitamin D levels in serum than healthy controls. It is not clearly defined, which are the levels of vitamin D in serum, that are high enough to trigger immunomodulatory effect and are safe for patients.
 This double-blind randomized clinical trial was designed to compare impact of vitamin D supplementation during four months in winter time in two different doses (1000 IU/day vs 4000
 IU/day) in patients with relapsing remitting MS. The main goal of this trial is to compare dose response on vitamin D supplementation and estimate more closely appropriate level of vitamin D in serum which triggers some of experimentally shown immunomodulatory actions. To define immunomodulatory response different laboratory, clinical and genetic tests will be performed."

 Pediatric tonsillectomy is one of the most common surgical procedures in the United States, with over 500,000 procedures performed annually.1,2 The most common indications for tonsillectomy with and without adenoidectomy are sleep-disordered breathing and recurrent tonsillitis, though significant demographic and regional variation exist.2 In recent years, particular attention has been paid to the deleterious sequelae of pediatric obstructive sleep apnea on children's behavior, cognition, and growth as well as its negative effects on long-term pulmonary and cardiovascular health.3-5 Tonsillectomy is generally considered a safe procedure, though potential exists for significant procedural morbidity. Potential risks associated with tonsillectomy include postoperative hemorrhage, airway risk, aspiration, burn injury, post-operative nausea and vomiting, and poor pain control.6,7 Postoperative hemorrhage is the most serious post-tonsillectomy complication and can be divided according to timing (primary occurring <24 hours from surgery, or secondary occurring >24 hours after surgery) and severity (level 1: any history of bleeding, level 2: bleeding requiring inpatient admission, level 3: bleeding requiring operative intervention). Following discharge, inadequate analgesia can result in secondary complications such as dehydration, nausea, bleeding, hospital readmission, and increased healthcare expenditures.8,9
 Significant controversy exists as to the optimal pain management protocol following pediatric tonsillectomy.8,9 Many studies have examined both pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic modalities to improve pain control in this population. The most common medications prescribed after tonsillectomy include acetaminophen (paracetamol), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (e.g. ibuprofen), and narcotic pain medications, each with a unique mode of action and risk profile.8,10-12 Acetaminophen, which has both peripheral and central anti-nociceptive properties, is generally well-tolerated with low incidence of serious side effects, but may not provide adequate pain control when used at recommended pediatric dosages.13 Narcotic (opioid) pain medications act on the mu opioid receptor and effectively decrease sensory and affective components of pain.14 Unfortunately, opioid pain medications also result in dose-dependent respiratory depression; a significant contraindication in patients with sleep-disordered breathing.15,16 The FDA has released a warning cautioning against the use of codeine, an opioid, for postoperative analgesia following tonsillectomy.7
 Furthermore, emerging data suggests that adolescent patients receiving prescription for narcotic pain medication may be at risk for long-term opioid dependence and addiction.17
 NSAIDs provide analgesia through reversible COX-1 and COX-2 pathway inhibition which results in decreased prostaglandin-induced inflammation and edema.18 This mechanism of action also interferes with platelet aggregation, potentially impacting bleeding in the postoperative period. Ibuprofen, a derivative of propionic acid, is one of the most commonly prescribed
 NSAID medications, with a half-life of less than 12 hours.19,20 Pain control in patients receiving NSAIDs is equivalent, or superior to, those receiving acetaminophen alone or in combination with narcotic medication.21-23 In 2011, the American Academy of Pediatrics released its Clinical Practice Guidelines, which stated that ibuprofen can safely be used for postoperative analgesia following tonsillectomy24, a recommendation based on a 2005 Cochrane
 Review of NSAIDs and post-tonsillectomy bleeding. The most recent Cochrane review on this topic, published in 2012 and based on 15 randomized control trials (RCTs), concludes that there is insufficient evidence available to exclude an increased risk of bleeding with NSAID use following pediatric tonsillectomy.25 This is supported by data from a prospective, randomized control non-inferiority trial conducted at our own institution, in which participants received either ibuprofen or acetaminophen for 9 days following surgery. In this study, an increased rate of post-tonsillectomy bleeding requiring operative intervention could not be excluded because the non-inferiority threshold was crossed. The duration of safe
 NSAID use, if any, after tonsillectomy is unknown. A study definitively documenting safety and efficacy of short-course NSAID administration following tonsillectomy in children would affect our own standard of care as well as overall clinical practice guidelines.
 This study serves as a follow-up clinical trial to a double-blind randomized control non-inferiority trial titled Postoperative Ibuprofen and the Risk of Bleeding After
 Tonsillectomy with or without Adenoidectomy conducted from 2012 to 2016 at Massachusetts Eye and Ear and collaborating institutions. In this study, participants were randomized to receive either ibuprofen (10 mg/kg every 6 hours) or acetaminophen (15 mg/kg every 6 hours) for 9 days following surgery. The non-inferiority margin was set at 3%. Increased type 3 bleeding (bleeding requiring operative intervention) could not be excluded because the non-inferiority threshold was crossed.
 In this study, type 3 bleeding occurred in the ibuprofen group on an average postoperative day of 5.95. Additional analyses were conducted on study subjects who discontinued the study drugs prior to postoperative day 9 (the scheduled end point). A total of 50 patients discontinued study medication on or before postoperative day 3. Of these, 21 were randomized to the ibuprofen arm and 0/21 experienced postoperative bleeding events.
 A recent systematic review by Tan et al examined commonly used medications following tonsillectomy and efficacy and risks associated with each drug.8 Acetaminophen is commonly used following tonsillectomy given its low side effect profile; however, analgesia is often inadequate at recommended dosages.26 Despite a 2013 FDA warning cautioning against opioid use following pediatric tonsillectomy due to increased risk of respiratory depression, these medications continue to be prescribed following surgery. The majority of tonsillectomies are now performed for sleep apnea and sleep disordered breathing; therefore, a large proportion of patients have increased risk of respiratory compromise and desaturations following surgery when opioid medications are administered.22 Furthermore, emerging data suggests that a significant fraction of adolescent patients receiving opioid pain medications postoperatively may subsequently develop addiction to these medications.17 NSAIDs are effective for post-tonsillectomy analgesia, but concerns remain regarding increased risk of postoperative hemorrhage with use of these medications despite current American Academy of Pediatrics recommendations advocate that ibuprofen may be safely utilized following tonsillectomy in children. Studies to date demonstrate conflicting or equivocal results with regard to increased bleeding risk following NSAID administration. Given previous data from this institution which cannot exclude increased incidence of type 3 bleeding following 9 days of ibuprofen exposure, MEE standard of practice is to recommend against extended duration of ibuprofen use in the postoplerative period. However, given concerns of inadequate analgesia with acetaminophen and respiratory depression and addictive potential with opioid medication, we feel that it is important to assess for postoperative time interval where NSAID medications may be safely administered without increasing incidence of postoperative bleeding events.
 We propose a study comparing impact of maximally-dosed ibuprofen (10 mg/kg every 6 hours) versus maximally-dosed acetaminophen (15 mg/kg every 6 hours) on postoperative pain and bleeding when administered for four days (short-course) to children age 2-18 undergoing tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy. We believe that a four-day course of medication is appropriate given that the majority of post-tonsillectomy bleeding events occurred on day 6 and the half-life of ibuprofen is such that platelet function returns to baseline within 24 hours of drug discontinuation20. We hypothesize that children aged 2-18 receiving short-course ibuprofen following tonsillectomy will not have increased incidence of bleeding when compared to patients receiving acetaminophen postoperatively. A study definitively documenting safety and efficacy of short-course NSAID administration following tonsillectomy in children would affect our own standard of care as well as overall clinical practice guidelines surrounding this procedure."

 Stress is a primary physiological response to physical and/or social threats resulting from a complex interplay of neurophysiological and psychological factors. Cognitive interpretations of social-evaluative threats have been found to be very potent emotional stressors. Apocrine sweat glands are stimulated by emotional stress, fear or mental tension. Upon secretion, apocrine sweat is odorless. By enzymatic action of the bacterial microbiome on apocrine sweat in particular, body malodor is formed. This is perceived as offensive by most societies. As a result, self-confidence and social relationships can be influenced by undesired body odor. A good understanding of the complex sweat-microbiome interactions leading to malodor formation is required for the development of effective malodor remedies.
 In the MOIST study it will be assessed whether the adapted Sternberg short-term working memory task (STMST) is an effective method to induce malodor formation by emotional stress, as assessed by expert assessments of stress-induced malodor formation in the armpits of 30 healthy male volunteers.
 Before, during and after being exposed to the adapted version of the STMST, saliva will be collected to determine cortisol levels, subjects have to rate their momentary feelings of anxiety and embarrassment and heart rate variability will be monitored continuously with a wireless signal transmission device. Before and after exposure to the adapted STMST, malodor levels will be assessed by two expert judges, axillary volatiles will be collected by cup scrubbing and microbiota samples will be taken to determine microbial species."

 Twenty-two (22) participants will be recruited from the University of Maryland Center for
 Multiple Sclerosis Treatment and Research. Participants will be included if they are aged 18-65, have a diagnosis of relapsing or progressive multiple sclerosis per revised 2010
 McDonald Criteria, and are planning to begin ocrelizumab therapy for multiple sclerosis, as prescribed by their treating physician. Participants will be excluded if they are unable to undergo an MRI due to metallic implants/devices or claustrophobia, have a history of allergy to gadolinium contrast, or are unable to provide informed consent.
 All participants will undergo a baseline/screening study visit prior to initiation of ocrelizumab. This will include signing of informed consent, a clinical interview to collect demographic and clinical data, a physical examination to calculate the EDSS score, and implementation of the component tests of the Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC).
 All participants will then undergo an MRI on a 7T Philips Achieva scanner (housed at the
 Kennedy Krieger Institute, Baltimore, MD). This will be a whole brain MRI, including 0.7mm3 resolution magnetization prepared 2 rapid acquisition gradient echo (MP2RAGE) and MPFLAIR images acquired both pre- and post-intravenous infusion of gadolinium contrast.
 MP2RAGE images will be processed to create T1 maps and T1-weighted images. All images (MPFLAIR included) will be co-registered to the pre-contrast MP2RAGE T1 map. Subtraction images will be created by subtracting the pre-contrast MPFLAIR scan from post-contrast images. Regions of hyperintensity on the subtraction image will be reviewed on anatomical images, and marked as regions of leptomeningeal enhancement if they have an amorphous appearance and are present in the leptomeningeal space.
 Participants who are found to have leptomeningeal enhancement on their baseline scan will be considered as having passed screening and will proceed with further study procedures. Those that do not have meningeal enhancement on a baseline scan will not return for a follow up visit.
 Participants who have passed screening (and thus have meningeal enhancement on their baseline scan) will then undergo initiation of ocrelizumab per clinical trial or commercial drug protocol as previously planned by their treating neurologists. Participants will then return for a follow up visit within 1 month after their 12 month ocrelizumab infusion. All of the above study procedures will be repeated on that date.
 Follow up images for each subject will undergo co-registration to the pre-contrast MP2RAGE T1 map. This will allow co-registered review of baseline and 1 year follow up MPFLAIR images side-by-side for review of the presence or absence of enhancing foci noted at baseline on the 1 year follow up scan. Subtraction images will also be created utilizing the 1 year pre- and post-contrast MPFLAIR scan for quantification of the number of enhancing foci on the 1 year follow up scan by the same procedures as above. A semi-automated region growing painting tool will be used to create masks over areas of contrast enhancement, which will be used to quantify enhancing focus volume on the baseline and follow up scan. Further, subtraction mapping will be utilized to highlight regions of hypointensity present in the cortex on
 MP2RAGE T1 that were not present on baseline MP2RAGE T1, which would indicate a new cortical lesion at follow up."

 Prosthetic dislocation following total hip arthroplasty (THA) remains a significant concern with a reported incidence of 0.2%-7.0% after primary and 10%-25% after revision THA. The risk of dislocation following THA is multifactorial and includes both surgeon-related factors (i.e. component positioning, surgical approach) and patient-related factors (i.e. gender, age). Dual mobility articulations have been shown to reduce the incidence of hip instability following THA. Dual mobility implants have been used in Europe for over 30 years, but have recently received an increased interest in the United States.
 Initial dual mobility designs consisted of a cementless, monoblock acetabular component with a highly-polished metal inner bearing surface. Modular dual mobility prostheses have been introduced in which a modular cobalt-alloy liner is inserted into a hemispherical titanium acetabular component. Advantages of this construct include familiarity of use of a standard titanium acetabular component and the ability to use supplemental screw fixation. However, the potential for fretting corrosion between the cobalt-alloy liner and the titanium acetabular component remains a concern.
 In a retrospective review of 100 consecutive patients undergoing primary THA using a modular dual mobility prosthesis, the authors found 21% of patients to have a serum cobalt level above the normal range, with 9% significantly above normal (> 1.6 ug/L), at a mean of 27.6 months postoperatively. In addition, a recent prospective cohort study of 26 patients receiving the same prosthesis showed elevated whole blood mean cobalt levels in patients receiving a modular dual mobility prosthesis versus patients receiving a conventional bearing (0.23 + 0.39 vs. 0.15 + 0.07ug/L, p<0.001) at 1 year postoperatively. Four patients in the dual mobility cohort had a whole blood cobalt level outside the reference range (maximum 1.81 ug/L).
 To the investigators knowledge no prospective, randomized controlled trial has been performed comparing dual mobility bearings to a conventional single-bearing design. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to compare the use of a conventional single-bearing ceramic-on-polyethylene surface to use of a modular dual mobility bearing in a prospective, randomized controlled setting."

 Objectives Learning retention after the deliberate practice of radiograph interpretation may be challenging for image types which are common enough to be clinically relevant but not so common that proficiency can be sustained through clinical practice. This is especially relevant for radiographs such as paediatric elbow films (EXR) that carry high risks for the patient if pathology is missed. Building on our prior research in this area, this study will develop an innovative computer learning application for paediatric EXR interpretation. After an initial learning period, this study will quantitatively determine the rate of skill decay and the optimal timing for refresher-education.
 Design A prospective cohort design with purposive sampling will be used to develop the EXR education intervention. A four arm randomized control trial will be used to test for the outcomes of skill decay and optimal timing of refresher education.
 Setting The education intervention will be developed at two tertiary care children's hospitals. Study participants will include physicians from two large paediatric education networks in the United States (Paediatric Outcomes in Simulation Education) and Canada (Paediatric Emergency Research Canada).
 Statistical analysis For the primary analysis, a four-group multi-level model with time-points nested within participants will be used. Secondary analyses will include a time series approach within each block of 20 test EXR to check for sequential effects, and between each block to determine whether we can efficiently model skill decay curves that can separate the underlying learning attrition curve from the effects of boluses of education.
 Conclusion This study anticipates that learners will increase their learning of elbow radiographs by participating in the deliberate practice of radiographs, with skill decay over time that will be mitigated by refresher education. The results will allow evidence based recommendations regarding refresher education for learning from item banks of radiographs."

 Music therapy (MT) interventions are a cost-effective, accessible, and holistic treatment option with social, rhythmic, creative, sensorimotor, and respiratory components, giving them the potential to improve the quality of life for a diverse array of disorders. Despite this, the literature surrounding MT is controversial due to the lack of standardization in clinical and research practice. Interventions range from passive listening of participant selected music to clinician lead improvisational sessions. This inhibits a mechanistic understanding of how MT functions, and what components produce therapeutic effects. Controlled studies that target physiological outcomes are vital for the development of evidence-based MT treatments.
 Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading cause of disability for U.S. and affects more than 16 million Americans each year. Existing interventions struggle to combat this societal burden and fail to reach the large number of treatment resistant patients, creating an urgent need for the development of new treatment paradigms. Hyperactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and dysregulation of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) have been implicated in MDD. Listening to music has been shown to alter stress hormone levels and heart rate variability (HRV), physiological correlates of the HPA axis and ANS respectively. Active music-making's effects on these correlates has yet to be studied. Since active musical engagement involves multiple sensory inputs—proprioceptive and motor in addition to auditory—it has the potential to heighten physiological changes associated with listening to music alone. By contrasting a structured participation MT intervention with a listening control, the investigators will target the effects of active participation in music-making as a potential treatment for MDD."

 The aim of this clinical study is to investigate and compare the postprandial glycemic response to three different meal types rich in carbohydrates, that is, white pasta, high protein pasta and white rice consumed by individuals with T1DM and to demonstrate that: 1. The choice of carbohydrates consumed significantly affects the postprandial glycemic profile in people with type 1 diabetes and 2. The consumption of high protein pasta will present a tighter postprandial glycemic response.
 Previous studies have evaluated the effect of white pasta and rice on postprandial glycemic response in people with type 1 diabetes. With this study, we aim to expand upon these findings by ensuring that the results can still be applied to more recent commercial food products (pasta, rice), but especially to evaluate the effect of high-protein pasta when compared to regularly consumed carbohydrates (white pasta, white rice).
 After consuming the study meal, subjects will participate in an education session (a 2 hour class per each meal challenge session). Classes will be taught by a registered dietician and diabetes & exercise expert and, as appropriate, a culinary instructor."

 The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of differential dose protocols commonly utilized in the post cesarean period to determine if laboratory definitions of anemia are different. Oxytocin is an antidiuretic hormone that is utilized after delivery of the fetus and placenta to contract the uterus and decrease blood loss both at the time of surgery and in the post-partum period. Here at the Penn State Hershey Medical center the investigators will use 20 units of oxytocin in a 1 L bag of LR in bolus fashion after delivery of the placenta. Other protocols use an extended course of therapy using 20 units of oxytocin in a 1
 L bag of LR in a bolus plus an additional 20 units of oxytocin in a 1 L bag of LR over an 8 hour period of time.
 We hypothesize that:
 -  Women who receive the standard 20 mU of oxytocin in 1L of LR in bolus fashion plus 20 mU in 1L over 8 hours will have a decreased reduction in pre-operative vs post-operative hematocrit and hemoglobin versus those that receive 20 mU in 1L of LR.
 -  Women who receive the standard 20 mU of oxytocin in 1L of LR in bolus fashion plus 20 mU in 1L over 8 hours will have decreased blood loss by weight in the postpartum period compared to patients who receive 20 mU in 1L of LR."

 Transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block is a promising effective method for postoperative pain control after major abdominal surgery. TAP block provides analgesia by inhibiting nerve conduction from the anterior abdominal wall arising from the intercostal nerves, subcostal nerves, and first lumbar nerve (T6-L1). Using a landmark technique, it is easily performed, but its popularity has decreased because of reduced efficacy due to inaccurate injection and the potential for intra-peritoneal organ damage. Ultrasound-guided TAP block provides better results and fewer complications, but it requires experienced operators. Surgically administered TAP (sTAP) block guided by the video camera of the laparoscope is a simple technique and may cause no complications. Also, under laparoscopic guidance, block of ilioinguinal, iliohypogastric, and genitofemoral nerves can be possible with anesthetic injection in the plane between psoas major and the fasciae covering its anterior aspects

 Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of pediatric lower respiratory tract infection. RSV also causes lower respiratory tract disease in the elderly and life-threatening disease in immunocompromised hosts. An RSV monoclonal antibody (palivizumab) is currently available for passive immunoprophylaxis in high-risk infants. Vaccines and antiviral agents are under development for the treatment and prevention of RSV, but none are licensed. The ability to challenge healthy volunteers with RSV could rapidly facilitate efficacy studies of future antivirals and vaccines. In addition, challenge studies would provide critical information on viral pathogenesis, including types of cells infected, mucosal and systemic immune response, and alterations in respiratory microbiota. Clinical trial material for human challenge studies has been prepared from live recombinant (complementary DNA-derived) RSV of subgroup A (RSV A2).
 This study will be a phase 1 study in healthy adult male and non-pregnant female subjects 18 years to 50 years of age. The main purpose of the trial is to define the safety profile, determine the frequency of RSV shedding in nasal wash, estimate RSV illness rates, and study immune responses in subjects given 1 dose of 10^7 PFU of RSV A2 challenge virus using a nasal atomizer. If RSV A2 is found to be sufficiently infectious in adults, then it may be used as a challenge virus in future studies evaluating antivirals or the protective efficacy of RSV vaccines, or in studies of the immunopathogenesis of RSV infection.
 Subjects will be admitted to the NIH Clinical Center and receive a single intranasal dose of 10^6.3 PFU or 107 PFU of RSV A2. Subjects will remain at the Clinical Center for approximately 9-14 days after challenge infection undergoing sequential clinical evaluations.
 Research specimens, nasal washes and blood, will be collected for various research assays.
 Subjects will be discharged when their daily nasal wash RSV result is negative for two days in a row, and they do not have any signs or symptoms suggestive of possible RSV-associated lower respiratory tract disease. Subjects will return for follow-up evaluation 28 and 56 days after viral challenge."

 Intestinal microbiota is defined as the strongest modulator of the human genome and it is considered the second brain of our organism for its bi-directional communication with the central nervous system. Microbiota consists of trillions of microorganisms located in all the biological cavity, In the intestine it is distributed in ecological niches having multiple metabolic activities which influence individual health. Microbiota acts as barrier against pathogens, regulating the absorption of nutrients, the production of energy and the development of the immune system4. Intestinal bacteria are generally divided into 4 Phylum:
 Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria and Bacteriodetes, in which their proportion shows a correlation with individuals health status. When in equilibrium among them, these bacteria are essential for the good health of the digestive tract, the good function of immune system and for brain performace. The relationships between individual health status and microbiota are based on a sort of mutual cooperation. The balance of the microbiota can be compromised by various factors such as environmental, psycho-physical stress, malnutrition (over or low), breastfeeding, chronic diseases, oncology and pharmacological treatments (especially antibiotics and chemotherapics). This disequilibrium leads to altered capability of bacteria to properly extract calories from food affecting the trend of many pathophisilogical status such as obesity, allergic states, inflammatory bowel syndromes cardiovascular diseases, metabolic, oncological and neurodegenerative diseases. The impact of dysbiosis on today's society affects over 70% of the world population"

 Antibiotic resistance has emerged world wide and is of major concern. Multidrug resistant (MDR) bacteria is widely spread and is now a major factor in morbidity and mortality in health-care settings. Among MDRs, carbapenem resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) are of special concern, receiving the highest classification of urgent threat level in the US
 President Report. Consistent mortality rates of 40-50% are observed among inpatients with infections caused by CRE in hospitals worldwide, related mainly to unavailable, delayed or ineffective antibiotic treatment options. The extremely high mortality rates of patients with
 CRE infections have driven efforts to prevent the acquisition and spread of these bacteria in hospitals. These include screening for carriage, contact isolation of carriers, cohorting, dedicated healthcare staff and other infection control measures. These strategies have been proven as effective but are cumbersome and expensive. In most locations these strategies failed to completely eradicate CRE endemicity. CRE decolonization (eradication of colonization) might offer a double benefit - reducing the risk for the individual carrier to develop an infection due to the resistant strain (by that, potentially lowering the mortality risk) and preventing the bacteria from spreading to other patients, exposing them to the same hazard. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), in which fecal material enriched with commensal microorganisms is transferred from a healthy donor, have proven efficacy in the treatment of recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) in multiple trails. Major adverse events that has been reported so far are mostly related to the route of administration (aspiration during nasogastric tube administration/colonoscopy). Other adverse events include mostly GI related symptoms (diarrhea, nausea, belching) and are self limited and resolve in few hours. FMT seems to be safe and effective both in immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients. The high efficacy of FMT in the treatment of a multi-drug resistant pathogen such as Clostridium difficile, suggest that it might be an efficient tool for other MDR pathogens (e.g. CRE). We aim to assess the effects of FMT on colonization and clinical infections with CRE. The potential of FMT to restore the gut microbiome and compete with residual resistant strains offer a novel way to fight the current MDR epidemic. FMT will be applied in a randomized open label fashion to CRE carriers in a single center in Israel and will be given by capsules for 2 consecutive days followed by rectal sampling at predefined timepoint in the following 6 months."

 Buprenorphine is classified as a partial mu opioid agonist and a weak kappa antagonist. In lower doses, buprenorphine has an analgesic potency 25 to 40 times more potent than similar milligram dosages of morphine. Consistent with its partial agonist activity, an apparent ceiling effect for opioid-induced ventilatory impairment has been demonstrated. These properties would suggest that buprenorphine is an effective analgesic with a favorable safety profile.
 Objective: The objective of this study is to determine if there is a clinically significant difference in reduction of pain scores, measured by the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS), between intravenous (IV) buprenorphine and IV morphine for severe pain in patients presenting to the
 Alameda Health System--Highland Hospital ED. The investigators are evaluating if IV buprenorphine is non-inferior to IV morphing. The investigators hypothesize that buprenorphine will provide equivalent analgesic effects as morphine at 60 minutes, with a lower proportion of medication adverse effects.
 Study Design: This is a double-blinded, randomized controlled non-inferiority trial comparing the analgesic efficacy of intravenous buprenorphine versus intravenous morphine for ED patients presenting with severe, acute pain.
 Participants: ED patients aged ≥18 years old who present with severe (pain NRS ≥7), acute pain warranting (according the treating provider's judgment) and able to receive IV opioid analgesia. The investigators will exclude pregnant patients, patients deemed too critically ill by the provider, patients with allergy to buprenorphine or morphine, patients in custody, patients on methadone, patients who have taken/received short acting opioid medications in the last 12 hours, and patients who have taken/received long acting opioid medication in the past 24 hours.
 Intervention: In arm A, patients will receive IV Buprenorphine 0.3mg diluted to a volume of 10mL with NS in a plastic syringe administered over 3-5 minute. In arm B, patients will receive IV morphine 0.1mg/kg (max 10mg) over 3-5 minutes. In both arms, at 20 minutes the patient will be asked would you like more pain medication? If he/she answers yes, then he/she will receive a second dose of the same amount of medication they previously received based on the randomized arm they were placed into. At the end of the study time, 60 minutes, the patient's ongoing pain management will be left to the attending physician caring for the patient in the ED.
 Data Collection: For both arms, the patients' NRS pain scores and adverse effects will be queried at times 0, 10min, 20 min, 30min, 40min, 50 min, and 60 min. Demographic and comorbidity data points will be abstracted during or after the study's conclusion."

 Temporal theta slow-wave activity (TTA-SW) in premature infants is a specific signature of the early development of temporal networks, as it is observed at the turning point between non-sensory driven spontaneous local processing and cortical network functioning. The role in development and the precise location of TTA-SW remain unknown. Previous studies have demonstrated that preterms from 28 weeks of gestational age (wGA) are able to discriminate phonemes and voice, supporting the idea of a prior genetic structural or activity-dependent fingerprint that would prepare the auditory network to compute auditory information at the onset of thalamocortical connectivity. They recorded TTA-SW in 26-32 wGA preterms. The rate of TTA-SW in response to click stimuli was evalu- ated using low-density EEG in 30 preterms."

NCT03685916,202725,2018-10-25T00:00:00Z,Clinical Trial Description,202725,AACT,"
 The study will be a non-blinded, randomised crossover trial with each participants testing between 2 to 4 different test ingredients requiring 5 or 9 separate test sessions (depending on how many the participants opt in for) on 9 non-consecutive days. The number of test ingredients that each participant will consume will be determined by the researcher and communicated to the participant. One of the test sessions will be a control session consisting of plain white rice (50 g available carbohydrates), with 20 g green vegetables being consumed with 200 ml of plain water. On the other hand, the test meal ingredients will be added either to the same amount of rice during preparation or will be added to 200 ml of plain water. The participants will be required to finish the meals within 15 minutes of serving. Appropriate food safety guidelines will be adhered to during the preparation and administration of test meals. We will be testing 20 separate food based traditional ingredients at either one or two doses. 20 participants will be recruited for each test food.
 Assuming that a minimum 2 test ingredients are tested in each participant up to 200 Chinese male participants aged between 21 and 60 years will be recruited from the general public in
 Singapore with body mass index between18.5 to 25.0 kg/m2, normal blood pressure (<140/90 mmHg), and fasting blood glucose (<7.0 mmol/L). The exclusion criteria are people who smoke, with any metabolic diseases (such as diabetes, hypertension etc), with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PD deficiency), with medical conditions and/ or taking medications known to affect glycemia (glucocorticoids, thyroid hormones, thiazide diuretics), intolerances or allergies to any foods, partake in sports at the competitive and/or endurance levels and individual who intentionally restrict food intake. Interested participants will first attend a consent and screening visit following an overnight fast to go over the informed consent procedure and ascertain their suitability to take part in the study. During this visit, the researchers will discuss the study in more detail and go through the participant information sheet and address any queries that the potential participant may have. If participants are willing to proceed, they will then be asked to sign the informed consent form and complete the screening visit forms and questionnaires. If suitable to proceed, they will then undertake the screening visit measurements including height, weight, waist circumference, body impedance and blood pressure measurements. If suitable at this stage, a finger prick blood glucose measurement will be carried out using the HemoCue® device (Helsingborg, Sweden). The visit should last approximately 1.5 hours. During each of the test days, participants will receive test meals in a random order made with up to 4 different food based test ingredients or the control meal (without any test ingredients). Randomisation of test meals will be done using the =RAND() function in Excel. The ingredients will tested in various doses and/or forms of consumption. The participants will arrive at the study centre following an overnight fast. After a 15 minute rest period, they will have a cannula inserted in their arm to obtain blood samples at regular intervals. There will be 9 blood draws in total per test session: Baseline (0 h, before test meal) and 8 blood samples after test meals at 0.25 h, 0.5 h, 0.75 h, 1.0 h, 1.5 h, 2.0 h, 2.5 h and 3.0 h. At each time point, we will collect 3 ml (about half a teaspoon) of blood. Therefore, for each test day, up to 30 ml blood will be taken and for the entire 9 test sessions, around 270 ml of blood will be collected (around 18 tablespoons) or if the participants only opt in for 5 test sessions, they will donate approximately 150 ml of blood (around 10 tablespoons). The blood samples collected at each timepoint will be measured for glucose, insulin and markers related to the intake of the test meal ingredients. At 4 time points (0 h, 1 h, 2 h and 3 h), seated blood pressure measurements will also be undertaken for 3 times, using an automated sphygmomanometer (Omron, Japan) and the average of the final two blood pressure readings will be taken as that given timepoint. Each test day should take no longer than 4 hours to complete. Participants will be asked to refrain from alcohol and exercise the day before each test day. The study will last between 4 and 12 weeks to compete and each test session will be undertaken on non- consecutive days, dependent on the participants' availability. The participants will be asked to continue with their usual lifestyle during their study participation when they are not attending the test sessions."

 Background and Objectives of the Study
 Cochlear Implantation A cochlear implant (CI) is a prosthetic device for the inner ear that bypasses damaged inner ear hair cells and directly stimulates the auditory nerve, thereby providing audible sensations to patients with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). The implanted part consists of a hermetically sealed electronics package, a receiver coil which communicates with external components, and a magnet to help align the internal and external receiver coils. Attached to the implant package is the lead assembly that includes an array of electrode contacts that is inserted into the cochlea and interacts with its stimulable elements, the spiral ganglion cells and the cochlear hair cells. Today's CI models have between 12 and 22 intra-cochlear electrode contacts, each of which can be independently stimulated. In the healthy cochlea, different pitches are perceived at distinct locations along the length of the cochlea. This tono-topic organization is utilized when stimulating the cochlea electrically, as individual contacts can preferentially address neural populations associated with discrete regions of the cochlea. For example, when a low-pitched sound is captured by the microphone of the external sound processor, stimulation is routed to more apical electrodes, while for high-pitched sounds more basal electrode contacts are engaged.
 Performance and Candidacy
 Cochlear implants are currently the standard-of-care for patients with significant SNHL and poor speech understanding. Preservation of the delicate anatomy within the cochlea is well-known to correlate with hearing and speech understanding outcomes. During electrode insertion, it is common for the surgeon to make subtle adjustments to insertion parameters such as the angle of insertion or speed of insertion; such modifications are part of the standard-of-care of conventional CI surgery. The current state of conventional CI electrode insertion provides the surgeon with no feedback as to whether and when the delicate structures of the cochlea are damaged. Such a tool by which the surgeon can obtain real-time measurements of the electrophysiological function of the cochlea could help improve the current surgical procedure.
 Electrocochleography
 One means of achieving this level of feedback is using electrocochleography (ECochG). ECochG is an objective electrophysiological reflection of peripheral acoustic-electric interactions within the cochlea. ECochG devices are FDA cleared Class II devices. An example of a cleared device is the Otometrics device (k143670). The FDA 510(k) clearance letter for this device is provided (See Appendix). During ECochG measurement, a brief acoustic tone burst with a defined frequency and level is delivered to the external ear canal. This results in normal physiologic movements of the outer and the inner cochlear hair cells. These movements produce small electrical potentials that can be sensed by a recording electrode placed near the cochlea (e.g., historically, on the promontory or the round window). Averaging of these recordings in synchrony with the acoustic stimulus allows the small ECochG signal to be reinforced while any physiological or electrical noise is averaged out.
 With ECochG measurements, the functional integrity of different elements of the peripheral auditory system can be examined. Specifically of interest, ECochG measurements can be resolved into the cochlear microphonic (CM) - generated by the cochlea's outer hair cells - and the auditory nerve neurophonic (ANN) - generated by the auditory nerve. By comparing the energy in the recorded signal at the measurement frequency with the noise floor of the measurement, behavioral hearing thresholds can be estimated with an accuracy of +/- 10 dB.
 Real-Time ECochG monitoring
 Advanced Bionics (AB), a manufacturer of FDA-approved CIs, has introduced a software approach to allow for utilization of ECochG during surgery. The prototype version of the AB-ECochG system has been successfully utilized in several clinical studies. The technological characteristics of the ECochG system utilized here are equivalent to existing FDA-approved systems.
 This protocol will utilize the latest system under development from AB that enables data collection with sufficient speed and precision to provide real-time observations to the surgeon during CI electrode insertion.
 Objectives
 This investigation does not involve a novel CI or a modification of an existing implantable device. The CIs to be used in this study are physically and technologically unchanged and have current FDA approval (Ultra MS: Model# CI-1600-04, FDA PMA Approval Number P960058/S117;
 Ultra Slim J: Model# CI-1600-05, FDA PMA Approval Number P960058/S121). Utilization of the device in the diagnosis and treatment of disease (i.e., hearing loss) is also unchanged and consistent with existing FDA-approved indications.
 ECochG systems themselves are not novel and have been in clinical use for many years. ECochG devices are FDA-cleared Class II devices. An FDA 510(k) clearance letter is provided (See
 Appendix). Use of ECochG for the purposes described here is consistent with indications covered under this FDA 510(k) clearance.
 The objective of this study is to learn about how ECochG-based observations during conventional CI surgery can improve outcomes compared to the standard-of-care technique of blind electrode insertion. Two clinically relevant outcomes will be considered: post-operative electrode location (i.e., correct electrode placement within the scala tympani) and hearing performance (i.e., postoperative audiometric thresholds in clinic).
 Significance
 Compared with previous relevant work, whereby ECochG was recorded near the cochlea before and after CI electrode insertion, recording ECochG from the vantage point of the CI's apical electrode within the cochlea during CI electrode insertion has the advantage of closer proximity to the ECochG signal generators (i.e., cochlear hair cells and the acoustic nerve).
 This approach has been shown to result in larger amplitude recording, and, thereby, more immediate feedback to the surgeon should these potentials change. An added advantage of this method is that it does not involve any change to the CI device itself, to the way the device is used, or to the surgical technique to place the device.
 The potential utility of ECochG during CI is illustrated by the following scenario: if the CI electrode touches the delicate structures of the cochlea (i.e., the basilar membrane or the spiral ligament) during insertion, the ECochG potentials become smaller in amplitude. With a real-time measurement system used during electrode insertion, decrease in ECochG potentials could be detected, and the surgeon could more purposely employ their modifications to insertion technique such as changing the insertion angle to avoid trauma or translocation.
 Use of intra-cochlear electrodes for ECochG offers an additional capability of observing potentials post-operatively in the clinic. ECochG allows an objective method of monitoring hearing at regular intervals over the early post-operative period and may give insights into hearing outcomes.
 Study Design
 A prospective, randomized, multi-center controlled study design will be used in this study.
 The total study duration will be up to two years. This study will be conducted in agreement with the Internal Review Board (IRB). The study will be registered through Clinical
 Trials.gov (account created; IRB approved).
 Outcome Measures
 The post-operative outcome measures of this study will be (1) the CI electrode's scalar position as indicated by post-operative computed tomography (CT) and (2) post-operative hearing performance. Following the clinical convention, the surgeon will pre-operatively select the type of CI electrode (i.e., the MidScala electrode or the SlimJ electrode) that they would like to use during surgery. As detailed below, the patient will then be randomized to audible ECochG signal off or audible ECochG signal on.
 Hypotheses
 The hypotheses of this study are that: 1. Changes in the ECochG signal observed during CI electrode insertion will correlate with insertion position outcomes as indicated by post-operative CT scan. 2. Participants randomized to ECochG audible response on will demonstrate a significantly lower rate of scalar dislocation compared to participants randomized to ECochG audible response off. 3. Changes in the ECochG signal during CI electrode insertion will correlate with post-operative audiogram. 4. Post-operatively, changes in the ECochG signal over time in clinic will correlate with changes observed over time in post-operative audiograms.
 Participants
 In total, 192 participants will be included in this study. This sample size was determined by a power analysis, detailed below in Statistical Analysis.
 Inclusion criteria are:
 -  Pure-tone audiometry thresholds ≤80 dB HL at 500 Hz
 -  One year of age and older
 -  Normal candidacy requirements for cochlear implantation met
 -  No cochlear abnormality that might prevent full insertion of the CI electrode array
 -  No additional handicap that would prevent study procedures from being followed
 Exclusion criteria are:
 -  Chronic otitis media
 -  Malformed cochlea
 -  Auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder (ANSD)
 -  Presence of ear tubes
 -  Prior middle ear surgeries or trauma including disruption of ossicles
 At any point in the study, the participants are free to end their involvement without any effect on their clinical care. Because this study does not involve any changes to the CI, its use, or the surgical technique, if a participant were to elect to end involvement in the study, it does not impact their treatment in any way. CI candidates meeting inclusion criteria will be given the opportunity to participate at the time of their regular pre-operative clinic visit or on the day of surgery itself.
 Randomization
 Interested CI candidates meeting study inclusion criteria will be randomized to one of two treatment arms. Randomization has been accomplished using a randomized block design to ensure that equal numbers of participants are included in each treatment condition. For each participating institution, an impartially designed randomization schedule has been drawn up with the assistance of a biostatistician. The arm to which participants are randomized will be unknown to the investigators at the time of enrollment and to the participants themselves. By necessity, surgeons themselves will be unblinded on the day of surgery.
 Figure 1 depicts the study's randomization arms and post-operative outcome measures.
 Arm 1: Audible ECochG Response Off
 This condition is identical to the current standard-of-care for conventional CI surgery used worldwide. The surgeon will perform his or her electrode insertion without ECochG monitoring.
 Minute manipulations of the electrode are a normal part of conventional electrode insertion; manipulations such as redirecting the insertion vector or slowing down insertion speed will be made, as deemed necessary by the surgeon. A full electrode insertion will be performed, as appropriate. The ECochG responses will be recorded, but the surgeon will be blinded to this information during surgery.
 Arm 2: Audible ECochG Response On
 This condition will have the audible ECochG response on and available to the surgeon. In this condition, the surgeon perform a conventional electrode insertion while listening to the running ECochG signal for drop in amplitude (suggesting impending trauma). If no drop is detected, insertion will proceed to the full electrode length according to the standard-of-care. If an ECochG amplitude drop is observed, the surgeon will place this observation in its clinical context and evaluate insertion parameters, (i.e., insertion vector, insertion speed, etc.), customary practice with conventional CI surgery, but here supplemented by the ECochG response. In the case of an ECochG amplitude drop that does not recover, the standard-of-care practice of achieving a full electrode insertion will be followed.
 Protocol timeline 1. Pre-Operative (typically 1-30 days before surgery) 1. Standard counselling regarding CI study; collect consent form for adults or assent form for pediatric participants; collect data release forms. 2. The surgeon makes his or her CI electrode selection between two options: (1) the
 HiFocus SlimJ (lateral wall array) or (2) the HiFocus MidScala. Electrode selection is a normal component of conventional CI surgery. All CIs models to be utilized in this study are FDA-approved and will be used within their approved indications (Ultra MS: Model# CI-1600-04, FDA PMA Approval Number P960058/S117; Ultra Slim J:
 Model# CI-1600-05, FDA PMA Approval Number P960058/S121). 3. Pure tone audiometry (standard-of-care pre-operative CI candidacy evaluation). In pediatric patients, for whom completion of pure tone audiometry may be difficult or unreliable, auditory brainstem response (ABR) testing can be used to supplement or estimate behavioural thresholds. 4. Pre-operative CT scan (standard-of-care) for surgical planning. 2. Day of surgery 1. Ensure that no cerumen or surgical preparation fluid is in the external ear canal.
 Place the ear piece in the external ear canal and fold the pinna forward, as in the conventional procedure. 2. Enter the pre-op audiogram into the software. 3. Normal CI surgical approach. A conventional round window or extended round window entry into the cochlea is prepared. 4. Measure ECochG in response to a 500 Hz tone burst stimulus, at 110 dB SPL, during insertion of the CI electrode and after insertion of the CI electrode. Figure 2 schematically depicts the intraoperative set-up. Figure 3 shows the non-invasive surface electrode and earphone array used in ECochG. Figure 4 shows the enclosure box and monitoring screen. i) For participants randomized to Arm 1 of the study, the surgeon will perform CI electrode insertion without ECochG feedback. ii) For participants randomized to Arm 2 of the study, the surgeon will make insertion modifications as appropriate in response to ECochG feedback. 3. Initial CI Activation Visit (3-5 weeks after surgery) a) Audio Assessment i) Unaided pure tone audiometry in the implanted and the unimplanted ear ii) Bone-conduction thresholds when possible, depending on the patient's residual hearing status iii) For pediatric patients, unaided audiometric data may be collected as tolerated, across different visits, to accommodate the unique challenges of hearing assessment of young children. b) Measure ECochG responses in clinic (to coincide with audiometry, +/- 1 week) i) 125-2000 Hz (frequency scan) ii) At an acoustic intensity level at or below their comfortable level through an insert earphone iii) Directly through the CI c) Post-Op CT scan to identify CI electrode scalar location i) Obtain scan within one month following surgery ii) Patient identifiers removed from CT scan data and sent to collaborators in
 DICOM format for analysis (See Appendix 1). 4. Approximately 3 Month Visit a) Audio Assessment i) Pure tone unaided audiometry in the implanted and the unimplanted ear ii) Bone-conduction thresholds when possible, depending on the patient's residual hearing status b) Measure ECochG responses in clinic (to coincide with audiometry, +/- 1 week) i) 125-2000 Hz (frequency scan) ii) At an acoustic intensity level at or below their comfortable level through an insert earphone iii) Directly through the CI 5. Approximately 12 Month Visit a) Audio Assessment i) Pure tone unaided audiometry in the implanted and the unimplanted ear ii) Bone-conduction thresholds as appropriate b)
 Measure ECochG responses in clinic (to coincide with audiometry, +/- 1 week) i) 125-2000
 Hz frequency scan ii) At an acoustic intensity level at or below their comfortable level through an insert earphone iii) Directly through the CI Detailed description of measurements and procedure Pure tone and bone-conduction audiometry Pure tone audiometry will be performed following the conventional, routine protocol currently in place for determining CI candidacy. Where possible, pure tone thresholds will be established in the implanted ear for 125, 250, 500, 750, 1000, 1500, 2000, 3000, 4000, 6000, and 8000
 Hz. Testing will be conducted using insert earphones, and where indicated, the contralateral ear will be masked. Both the implanted and the non-implanted ear will be measured. If clinically appropriate, bone-conduction testing will be performed as well following conventional practices. For young children in our cohort, for whom hearing testing can be uniquely challenging, thresholds obtained across more than one visit will be permitted and thresholds may be estimated base on auditory brainstem response (ABR) testing.
 In line with the Minimum Reporting Standards for Adult Cochlear Implantation recommendations, in patients with functionally relevant pre-operative low frequency pure tone averages (125, 250, 500 Hz) < 80 dB HL, post-operative residual hearing will be reported. Each frequency will be reported individually (125, 250, 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, 4000, and 8000 Hz) rather than as a pure tone average.
 Electrocochleography
 In the operating room, a 500 Hz tone burst will be presented to the participant at a 110 dB
 SPL through an insert earphone in the external auditory canal. This acoustic stimulus will provoke movements of remaining inner and outer cochlear hair cells and evoke a response from the auditory nerve. Tone burst stimuli at 500 Hz have been shown to produce the largest amplitude ECochG response, therefore, will be used as the default stimulus here. The resulting cochlear potentials will be recorded using the recording electrode from the apical aspect of the CI electrode. By averaging the recorded signal synchronized with stimulus delivery, the responses can be reinforced while unsynchronized noise will average out. This utilization is consistent with indications covered under this FDA 510(k) clearance.
 Intra-operative preparation
 The insert earphone will be placed in the external ear canal after cerumen removal. The ear canal will be surgically prepared, followed by suctioning of prep fluid. Following the conventional technique, the measurement ear will be folded forward and taped. The surgery will proceed following the standard-of-care practice consisting of a cortical mastoidectomy, a facial recess (posterior tympanotomy), and preparation of intracochlear access via the round window or an extended round window approach. Before the CI electrode will be inserted, the headpiece will be connected to the implant, and the ECochG software will be triggered to begin the ECochG recordings. Figure 2 depicts a schematic of the measurement system setup.
 Figure 3 shows an example of the noninvasive surface electrode and earphone array. Figure 4 shows the monitor and unit through which the ECochG is observed and recorded.
 To facilitate correlation of changes in ECochG potentials during CI electrode insertion and surgical events that ultimately relate to trauma within the cochlea, the surgeon will verbally indicate the progress of electrode insertion (e.g., at the round window, at the first marker on the electrode, at the last marker on the electrode), which will be recorded in the software by an assistant and synched with the ECochG signals.
 Post-operative ECochG
 For post-operative ECochG measurements in the clinic, the setup depicted in Figure 3 will be utilized. For this testing, the external component of the CI will be temporarily removed (equivalent to simply taking off a hearing aid) and replaced with an external head coil component (physically identical to the CI's external head coil) that allows for ECochG measurement. After connecting the head piece, a frequency scan from 125-2000 Hz will be presented to the participant at an acoustic intensity level at or below their comfortable listening level through an insert earphone in the external auditory canal. After measurements are collected, the participant's own external component will be put back in place. This measurement takes up to 5 minutes and does not require active participation of the participant.
 CT Scan
 A single post-operative CT scan will be conducted to identify the electrode's scalar location. A post-operative CT scan is often performed as a part of the regular clinical routine in patients for whom more information about the CI electrode location is needed. The post-operative CT will be collected per parameters outlined in Appendix 1.
 Risks
 The chief risks associated with this study are those inherent to CI surgery itself. The use of intraoperative ECochG has been well-demonstrated to pose no added patient risks, but may, as discussed above, provide an important benefit. Participation in this study will involve the following specific considerations: 1. Increased surgical time: The ECochG measurement procedure adds up to 5-15 minutes to the procedure. During this added procedure time, the Anesthesia team will closely monitor the patient. If there are any concerns at any time, the study activity will be ceased. 2. Post-operative CT scan: Associated radiation exposure. The implant, sound processor, and the clinical programming interface (CPI) hardware are all FDA-approved, and their use in the study is not associated with any additional risk to the patient. ECochG devices are
 FDA-cleared Class II devices. For an example of an FDA 510(k) clearance letter for the
 Otometrics device (k143670), please see Appendix. The ECochG recording software is not
 FDA/Conformité Européenne (CE) certified, but it has been thoroughly tested per AB's internal quality system. The recording software is not part of the CI operation and does not introduce any new or changed risk to the patient. It has been verified that the experimental software does not affect the performance of the FDA-approved software or hardware. Further, the entire protocol detailed above has been utilized and reported upon across several institutions validating the feasibility, ease, and safety of this modification to the convention no feedback approach to CI electrode insertion. This study's principal investigator (PI) also has experience using the current system.
 Data Acquisition and Storage
 Post-operative audiometric measurements and post-operative CT scan results will be recorded in the participant's study binder. Results of intra-operative and post-operative ECochG will be saved by the ECochG software program but will also be printed and kept in the participant's binder. All files will be archived. The main study results will be transferred to Excel-files for analysis. Further analyses will be done with Excel, Matlab or statistical software packages. A member of the Biostatistics Department will assist in statistical analysis. All results will be made anonymous prior to being shown to any third party. It will not be possible for any individual study participant to be recognized from his or her study data.
 In addition, we will compare ECochG-based predictions associated with CI electrode scalar position and hearing outcomes to predications made based on conventional demographic and audiometric data. To facilitate multivariate analysis, we will extract biographical (e.g., age, etiology of hearing loss, duration of deafness) and surgical (e.g., device and electrode type) factors from the electronic medical record.
 Statistical Analysis
 Randomization
 Block randomization is statistical strategy to prevent unequal numbers of participants from being randomized to one arm vs the other (here, audible signal on versus audible signal off). For example, using a random number generator set to individually assign 100 participants to one of two groups, there is no assurance that an equal numbers of study participants would end up in the audible signal on group, resulting in an unbalanced overall sample, despite randomization of each participant.
 Using a block approach, the total sample is divided into smaller blocks and randomization is performed within each block with the rule that the number of allocations is balanced within that block. In our study, although each institution will likely only contribute about 40 participants, we have designed a randomization schedule to allow for 100 participants to be run for each program. This sample of 100 was divided into 50 blocks of two participants; the two participants are randomized ensuring that one goes into the signal off group and one goes to the signal on group.
 Power Analysis
 To ensure that our study is appropriately powered to detect a significant difference in the primary outcomes measures, we performed a power analysis with the assistance of a biostatistician. Post-operative CT-based indication of scalar position is treated as a dichotomous variable (i.e., either in the scala tympani or in the scala vestibuli); post-operative hearing outcomes are treated as a continuous variable.
 Scalar Dislocation: Preliminary data indicates that the current state of CI electrode dislocation from the scala tympani to the scala vestibuli is approximately 35% (or, a successful scala tympani position is achieved at a rate of 65%). For participants randomized to ECochG audible signal on, our expectation, driven by preliminary data, is to decrease the rate of scalar dislocation to approximately 15% (or, a successful scala tympani position rate of 85%). Setting the alpha error rate at 2.5%, a total sample size of 192 participants, or 96 participants in each of the two randomization groups, was determined using a Fischer exact test. If we permit a 5% error rate, the total sample size drops to 162 patients (81 randomized to audible signal on; 81 randomized to signal off). While these numbers of participants are higher than would be possible to achieve at our site alone in an average two-year period, through a coordinated effort to pool multi-center data, it will be easily achievable.
 Secondary Planned Analysis
 Electrode Type: As detailed above, once a participant is enrolled in the study, the surgeon will select which of two CI electrodes are most appropriate. A secondary analysis comparing scalar position and hearing preservation outcomes will be performed (i.e., four total between-group analyses) between the two electrode groups.
 Pediatric Participants: This study will include both adult and pediatric participants. A secondary analysis comparing scalar position and hearing outcomes between adult and pediatric participants will be performed (again, four total between-group analyses).
 Regression Analysis: To model the influence of ECochG on on the primary outcome measures in the context of participant age group and electrode choice, two regression analyses will be performed - one for the outcome measure of scalar position and one for hearing outcomes.
 Hospital Effect Analysis: To determine if there is a meaningful difference in outcome measures across the different participating hospital settings, a secondary analysis will be performed as well.
 Safeguarding of Protected Health Information (PHI) Upon study enrollment, participants will be assigned an alphanumeric code that will be used to track their data. A code key will be maintained by the investigators on a secure server and accessed using password-protected computers located in a locked office in a secure research space. Participant identity cannot be discovered from ECochG data. Likewise, CT images and audiometric data will not reveal participant identity and will be made fully anonymous prior to sharing with any third party.
 Participant study binders, labeled using their alphanumeric code only, will be stored in a locked cabinet, in a locked office, in a secure research area accessible only to the investigators."

 Objective: Apathy is one of the earliest and most profound disturbances that occur in
 Alzheimer's dementia (AD). Based on promising preliminary data from our open-label pilot study we propose a double blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial of methylphenidate for treatment of apathy in AD.
 Research Design: Randomized double blind, placebo-controlled study which will evaluate the effect of methylphenidate on apathy and also the impact of improvement of apathy on caregiver burden and functional status.
 Hypotheses: 1. Methylphenidate will improve apathy significantly more than placebo in AD. 2. Successful treatment of apathy will improve Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADLs), and caregiver burden.
 Methodology: 60 patients with apathy in the context of AD will be recruited over the next three years. In our proposed study patients will be recruited from relevant clinics at the
 Omaha Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC) including clinics in Geriatric Psychiatry,
 Neurology, Primary Care and Geriatric Medicine. 30 patients each with AD and apathy will be randomly assigned to placebo or MPH. All patients in the methylphenidate arm will be started at 5mg twice daily and titrated to 10mg twice daily at two weeks. Patients will be continued in this arm for 12 weeks followed by a 2-week discontinuation phase. Patients will be assessed on regular intervals using the Apathy Evaluation Scale, Instrumental Activities of
 Daily Living, Zarit Burden Scale and Mini Mental State Examination.
 Findings: None, the study is not complete.
 Clinical Relationships: While memory is the key cognitive problem in AD, apathy is the key behavioral problem. Apathy is characterized by indifference, disengagement, passivity, and lack of enthusiasm, interest, empathy and interpersonal involvement. Apathy is the most common, one of the earliest and probably the most persistent of behavioral problems in AD.
 Apathy is the most disturbing behavior to caregivers and has the greatest impact on functional status and caregiver burden.
 Despite this, apathy as a behavioral problem has largely been neglected. Most of the research directed towards behavioral problems in dementia is targeted towards more visible behaviors such as agitation, and psychosis. Remarkably, there are no published randomized, double blind, placebo controlled studies in the treatment of apathy associated with AD.
 Impact/Significance: Around 1.4 million veterans suffer from apathy in association with AD.
 Apathy is a strong predictor for functional decline and caregiver burden. Treatment of apathy is remarkably understudied and is absolutely critical to allow veterans to maximize their functional status, social engagement and quality of life, and thus delaying placement in assisted living or nursing home settings."

 Background
 Guidelines for antimicrobial prophylaxis for cardiac surgery advise using first generation cephalosporin for those children coming from home. Large number of children that pass cardiac surgery in Hadassah University Hospital, Jerusalem, are hospitalized for several days before the operation in Pediatric Surgery department due to administrative reasons. These children receive broad spectrum antibiotics, vancomycin and ceftazidime, as a peri-operative prophylaxis, in order to prevent infection with hospital acquired flora with which they could become colonized with during this period. This policy causes exposure to broad spectrum antibiotics from the beginning in these children, and also providing an antimicrobial pressure in the intensive care unit, influencing the development of resistant flora.
 There is no documentation that these children acquire resistant flora during there hospitalization in the pre-operative period. We suggest checking microbial flora in those children hospitalized for cardiac surgery, in order to determine the need for broad spectrum antimicrobial prophylaxis.
 Goals
 To check microbial flora in children hospitalized for cardiac surgery on different time points: on admission and during hospitalization in Pediatric Surgery Department, on admission to PICU (immediately after operation),after 3 - 5 days,when drains are extracted.
 To document if there is a change in resistance pattern of microbial pathogens during these periods
 To determine the optimal regimen for antimicrobial prophylaxis for those children who need to be hospitalized in this department before the operation
 Methods

 The objective of the study is to determine the safety and efficacy of the combination of docetaxel and liposomal doxorubicin chemotherapy combined with enoxaparin in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.
 Docetaxel (TAXOTERE) belongs to the group of anticancer drugs called mitotic inhibitors.
 Liposomal doxorubicin (Doxil) is an anthracycline, and is thought to prevent nucleic acid synthesis that is needed to make DNA. Enoxaparin (Lovenox) is an anticoagulant. We are interested in combining chemotherapy with the blood thinner enoxaparin because there is a scientific link between blood clotting and malignancy.
 This research is being done to improve on currently available chemotherapy treatments for advanced pancreatic cancer. The main goal of the study is to find out if this combination chemotherapy and enoxaparin increases the number of individuals whose tumors shrink. Another purpose of this study is to find out how this study treatment effects blood clotting levels in individuals. We will also determine the incidence of elevated D-dimer and the effect of this regimen on the level of D-dimer, and collect safety data on this regimen."

 Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a worldwide health problem, with an estimated incidence of up to 69 cases per 100,000 persons annually. In the U.S., 101,000 patients were hospitalized with a primary diagnosis of PE in 2002, resulting in direct medical costs of $720 million. There is growing evidence that outpatient treatment with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is an effective and safe option for up to 50% of patients with non-massive PE. Despite this evidence, outpatient treatment of PE is uncommon because (1) explicit criteria that identify patients who are at low-risk of adverse medical outcomes have not been available, and (2) randomized trials demonstrating the effectiveness and safety of outpatient treatment have not been performed. We developed a clinical prognostic model that accurately identifies patients with PE who are at low-risk for short-term mortality, symptomatic recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE), and major bleeding. This model provides clinicians an easily applied, explicit risk stratification tool for patients with PE, addressing a key barrier to outpatient treatment. The broad objective of this clinical trial is to address the other major barrier to outpatient treatment of low-risk patients with non-massive PE, the effectiveness and safety of outpatient management. We will randomize low-risk patients (identified using our prognostic model) with PE from hospital emergency departments to receive outpatient or inpatient treatment with LMWH for ≥5 days, followed by oral anticoagulation. The specific aims of the project are to compare (1) the frequency of recurrent VTE, (2) the frequency of major bleeding and all-cause mortality, and (3) medical resource utilization and patient satisfaction with care among patients randomized to receive outpatient or inpatient treatment with LMWH. The primary study outcome will be the rate of symptomatic recurrent VTE at 3 months after randomization. The secondary outcomes will be the rate of major bleeding and all-cause mortality. The ancillary outcomes will be medical resource utilization and patient satisfaction with care. The hypotheses guiding this trial are that outpatient treatment with LMWH is as effective and safe as inpatient treatment with
 LMWH, and is also associated with reduced medical resource utilization and increase patient satisfaction with care. This study is innovative because it translates a validated prognostic model into clinical practice and represents the first direct comparison of outpatient versus inpatient treatment of low-risk patients with PE. Successful completion of this project will provide a strong scientific basis for treating low-risk patients with PE in the outpatient setting. Outpatient management of low-risk patients with PE is likely to improve quality and efficiency of care by reducing resource utilization and increasing patient satisfaction with care. Our findings will have importance to physicians, hospitals, and policy-makers who are committed to optimizing patient safety and providing high-quality, cost-effective care."

 Hypothesis: Deferring antiretroviral therapy in infants who have immune reconstitution and adequate growth following early therapy of primary infection (initiated HAART during primary infection at less than 13 months of age) will not compromise clinical status or growth and may spare antiretroviral toxicity.
 Specific Aim/Primary Objective: To compare growth and morbidity in infants (who initiated
 HAART during primary infection at less than or equal to 13 months of age with subsequently normalized CD4% and growth following 24 months of HAART) randomized to deferred versus continuous therapy and followed for an additional 18 months.
 Secondary Aim/Secondary Objective: To determine predictors of non-progression of HIV among the infants, including: age, adherence, HIV-1 specific immune responses, baseline HIV-1 RNA,
 CD4 percent and immune activation.
 Design: Randomized clinical trial involving HIV-1 treatment of infants (<13 months old) for 24 months, followed by randomization and 18 months follow-up of children randomized to continued versus deferred treatment. This trial is unblinded.
 Population: HIV-1 infected infants (<13 months) newly initiating HAART and HIV-1 infected infants already receiving HAART who initiated HAART at age <13 months will be enrolled. After 24 months of treatment follow-up, children with CD4% > 25% and normalized growth will be retained in the study and randomized.
 Sample size: 150 infants will be enrolled of which 100 are expected to be eligible for randomization (50 in each arm).
 Treatment: All infants will be treated with HAART according to WHO and Kenyan national guidelines. The specific regimens that will be used as a part of this study are:
 First line regimen
 -  AZT/3TC/NVP (zidovudine/lamivudine/nevirapine)
 -  d4T/3TC/NVP (stavudine/lamivudine/nevirapine)

 The primary purpose of the proposed research is to compare the effectiveness of brief intervention, brief intervention plus a booster and treatment as usual for adult patients with an alcohol related injury. The primary outcomes of interest in the proposed trial are injury recidivism, alcohol intake, and alcohol problems. Because brief alcohol interventions with injured patients are opportunistic in nature, the patient's motivation to change or stage of change likely influences their response to brief intervention as well as the need for additional intervention. Therefore, the primary hypothesis of the proposed research is that patients presenting for treatment of an alcohol related injury who are in the precontemplation or contemplation stages of change require brief intervention with booster while patients in the preparation or action stages of change benefit equally from brief intervention alone or brief intervention plus booster. That is, an interaction between the patient's stage of change (Precontemplation and Contemplation or Action) at enrollment and treatment type (Brief Intervention, Brief Intervention with Booster and Treatment as Usual) is hypothesized to influence treatment effect at follow up. In addition, the impact of intervention on the patient's motivation to change at follow up will be assessed."

 Hypothesis:
 Diclofenac, when administered immediately post ERCP in patients at higher risk of developing post-ERCP pancreatitis, will significantly reduce the incidence of this complication.
 Intervention:
 All patients undergoing ERCP not having exclusion criteria will be approached for participation prior to the procedure. At the end of the procedure, prior to transfer from the endoscopy suite, within 15 minutes of the end of the procedure, if the patient meets inclusion criteria, a study suppository will be administered.
 The suppositories will be prepared by a study pharmacist according to a randomization list prepared by an independent biostatistician. They will be randomized using a permuted block design, in blocks of 20. The placebo is inert, and identical to the study medication, a 100 mg diclofenac rectal suppository. The code will not be broken until enrolment of patients is complete.
 Patients, endoscopists, nurses, and the principal investigator will all be blinded to the randomization code.
 Outcomes:
 Post-ERCP acute pancreatitis is the primary outcome. Consensus definition of this is new typical (epigastric/retroperitoneal) pain combined with an elevation of serum lipase or amylase >3 times the upper limit of normal. Pain will be assessed through history and physical exam by an attending gastroenterologist the morning after the procedure, with documentation in the chart and research form of the presence or absence of pain. Serum amylase will be measured the morning after the procedure, between 7 and 10 am (approximately 18 hours post procedure). Most patients will be inpatients but outpatients will be included if they can be assessed through clinical exam and blood chemistry analysis the following morning. Patients will be contacted one week after the procedure to ensure no episode of abdominal pain or bleeding has been missed.
 Statistics and Power Calculation
 A two sided Fisher's Exact Test will be used to compare the proportion of patients developing post-ERCP pancreatitis in each group (placebo vs. active drug).
 In the population selected, the estimated risk of pancreatitis is 15%. To demonstrate a decrease to 5%, 141 patients will be required in each group, with 80% power and an alpha error 0.05. Secondary outcomes will include severity of pancreatitis, hyperamylasemia, length of stay, and mortality. Safety data regarding renal function and GI bleeding will also be collected."

 Busulfan and melphalan are both traditional alkylating agents that are designed to interfere with the production of cancer cells at the DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) and RNA (ribonucleic acid) level.
 Before you can start treatment on this study, you will have what are called screening tests. These tests will help the doctor decide if you are eligible to take part in the study. You will have a complete physical exam, including routine blood (2-3 teaspoons) and urine tests. Patients will have a chest x-ray, heart scan, lung function test, and a bone marrow biopsy. Women who are able to have children must have a negative blood pregnancy test.
 If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be able to start receiving chemotherapy treatment with busulfan and melphalan. Participants who agree to the optional blood draws described above will at first receive a therapeutic trial dose of busulfan by vein to test the blood levels over time. This therapeutic trial dose of busulfan is about 25% (1 fourth) of the full therapeutic dose of the drug. This information will be used to decide what the future high-dose busulfan treatments you receive will be. If you do not agree to the optional blood draw, you will receive a fixed amount of high-dose busulfan from the start.
 On the 1st day of hospitalization, you will receive fluids by vein through a central venous catheter. If you choose the optional busulfan dose for pharmacokinetic-based busulfan dosing, you will receive the optional busulfan dose 9 days before stem cell infusion (Day 1), followed by a rest day on Day 2. If you choose to receive a fixed dose of busulfan, busulfan will be injected through a central venous catheter over 3 hours, once a day, for the next 4 days (Days 3-6, ending 3 days before the stem cell infusion day).
 Patients receiving pharmacokinetic-based dosing of busulfan will also continue to receive busulfan on Days 3-6. This will be followed by melphalan for all patients, given through your central venous catheter over 30 minutes, once a day, for 2 days, on days 8 and 9. Your stem cell infusion day will be on Day 10 of treatment.
 Patients receiving 5 out of 6 antigen matched-related allogeneic stem cell transplants or unrelated allogeneic stem cell transplants will also receive antithymocyte globulin (ATG), by vein, on Days 7-9, up to one day before the stem cell infusion. This is given to decrease the risk of GVHD and graft rejection in mismatched transplants.
 On Day 10, healthy blood stem cells or bone marrow from the donor will be given through the central catheter. This is your transplant date. You will also receive several other medications to help the treatment work and to help prevent infections while your immune system is weak. Tacrolimus and methotrexate will be given to decrease the risk of graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD). GVHD occurs when the donor's immune cells fight the patient's body. The tacrolimus will be started on the day before the transplant and will continue for up to six months. Tacrolimus is given by vein at first and then by mouth when you are able to eat. Methotrexate is given by vein on Days 11, 13, 16, and possibly on Day 21, up to 11 days after the transplant.
 Please note that the treatment dates listed above were used to help explain your general treatment plan. By standard medical convention, the day of stem cell infusion is always listed as day zero. Therefore, the days listed above are different from the treatment plan described in the protocol and abstract.
 Sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim) or pentamidine will be given to fight bacteria. Bactrim is given by mouth when the counts are good. Pentamidine is given by vein when the counts are low.
 Acyclovir will be given at first by vein and then Valtrex (valacyclovir) will be given by pill to decrease the risk of viral infections. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) will be given to help the new bone marrow grow. It is given as an injection under the skin after the transplant. It will continue until the white blood cells reach an acceptable level.
 Overall, some of these drugs will be given for as long as 6 months or possibly longer. Other medications may be necessary. If you are allergic to some of these drugs, changes will be made.
 You will be in the hospital for about 3-4 weeks. You will have checkups every day until discharged from the hospital. You will then be seen in the outpatient clinic at least 3 times a week until your blood counts improve. You will be seen by your doctor at least every week until 100 days after the bone marrow transplant. You must stay in Houston during this time.
 After 100 days, you will return to the clinic according to your individual physician's recommendations.
 Some patients may need to receive spinal taps with instillation of chemotherapy several times over the year after transplantation. This is only for patients with a previous clinical history of leukemic involvement of the brain or high risk of developing leukemia relapse in the brain. The spinal tap is performed in the clinic. You are given local anesthetic at the lower back site, a small needle is inserted in the space between 2 spinal bones, a small amount of fluid that bathes the brain (cerebrospinal fluid) is removed for testing, and a small amount of chemotherapy is given.
 Bone marrow samples will be taken at about 1 month and 3 months after the transplant. You will also have a lung function test at 3 months after the transplant.
 This is an investigational study. The FDA has approved all of the drugs used in this study for use in stem cell transplantation. Up to 168 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson."

 Before treatment starts, patients will have their bone marrow checked and will have lung, heart, and kidney tests.
 Patients in this study will receive the drugs fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and antithymocyte globulin by vein through a previously inserted plastic catheter that extends into the large chest vein. Fludarabine will be given daily for four days, cyclophosphamide will given daily for four days, and antithymocyte globulin will be given daily for four days (three days for related donor transplants).
 Two days after the last dose of cyclophosphamide, donor marrow or stem cells will be infused through a catheter (thin plastic tube). Drugs will be given to lower the chance of an allergic reaction to the stem cells. Patients will also get shots of filgrastim (a drug that helps white blood cell growth) and antibiotics by mouth. The blood cell counts will fall to low levels during the first 2 weeks when patients may need transfusions of red blood cells and platelets. The chemotherapy will be given in the hospital. After the infusion of stem cells, patients will be monitored in the hospital. They will later be closely followed as outpatients and will be required to remain in the Houston area for about three months after the transplant.
 Drugs (cyclosporine and methotrexate) to lower the chance of graft-versus-host disease will be given. Cyclosporine will be given as a continuous infusion starting 2 days before transplantation. Methotrexate will be given through the catheter on Days 1, 3, 6 and 11 after transplantation. Cyclosporine will be given as pills when the patient is able to swallow.
 Cyclosporine will be continued for no less than 6 months after transplantation after which it will be gradually stopped. The drug tacrolimus may be used instead of cyclosporine.
 Blood, urine, bone marrow, and x-ray exams will be done as needed to monitor the results of bone marrow transplantation. Patients may require blood and platelet transfusions. Blood tests will be done daily while hospitalized and several times a week until the blood counts recover. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsies will be performed before the transplant, when the donated cells show signs of engraftment, and at other times during the next 1 to 3 years.

 Background:
 Primary spontaneous pneumothorax most commonly occurs in young, tall, lean males (1, 2). The estimated recurrence rate is 23-50% after the first episode (3). Optimal treatment of patients presenting with a first episode of primary spontaneous pneumothorax remains unknown.
 In the recently published British Thoracic Society (BTS) guidelines (4), simple aspiration is recommended as first line treatment for all primary pneumothoraces requiring intervention.
 However, the 1 year recurrence rate of this procedure was as high as 26-30% (5), making it inappropriate as a standard of care.
 Intrapleural instillation of a chemical irritant (chemical pleurodesis) is an effective way to shorten the duration of air leaks and reduce the rates of recurrent spontaneous pneumothorax in surgical and non-surgical patients (6, 7). Light et al. has shown that intrapleural tetracycline is effective in reducing the rate of ipsilateral recurrence for patients with spontaneous pneumothorax (7). However, the recently published guidelines recommended that chemical pleurodesis should only be attempted if the patient is either unwilling or unable to undergo surgery because the rates of recurrence of pneumothoraces after surgical intervention either by thoracotomy or VATS, with or without surgical pleurodesis, is far less than after chemical pleurodesis (4, 8). As a result, chemical pleurodesis has rarely been used in primary spontaneous pneumothorax, and the effect of additional chemical pleurodesis after simple aspiration in preventing recurrence of pneumothoraces has never been evaluated.
 Tetracycline, which was the most commonly used irritant, is no longer available. Minocycline, a derivative of tetracycline, is as effective as tetracycline in inducing pleural fibrosis in rabbits (9). In the previous studies, we have shown that additional minocycline pleurodesis is a safe and convenient procedure that associates with lower rates of prolonged air leaks and ipsilateral recurrence after thoracoscopic treatment of primary spontaneous pneumothorax (10, 11).
 In the present study, additional minocycline pleurodesis will be randomly administered in patients with first episode of primary spontaneous pneumothorax after simple aspiration to test if it can reduce the rate of recurrence. This study will comply with the protocol, GCP and applicable requirement of the Institutional Review Boards (IRB) of the NTUH and Far
 Eastern Memorial Hospital.
 Patients and Methods:
 Study design This study is a prospective, randomized, controlled trial to evaluate if additional minocycline pleurodesis after simple aspiration will be effective in preventing recurrence of primary spontaneous pneumothorax.
 Primary Objective The primary end point is to compare the rates of ipsilateral recurrence between the minocycline and observation groups after simple aspiration of the pneumothorax.
 Secondary Objectives 1. Safety profile of minocycline pleurodesis 2. Early results, including immediate success rates, one-week success rates, complication rates, rates of hospitalization, duration of hospitalization, and the degrees of chest pain. 3. Long-term effects of minocycline pleurodesis, including degrees of residual chest pain and pulmonary function test.

History of significant neurologic or psychiatric disorders, including dementia or seizure. 5. Active infection requiring i.v. antibiotics. Subjects who are unwilling to undergo randomization, treatment, or follow-up procedures will be removed from the study.
 Subjects can also withdraw from the trial at any time point by their will.
 Randomization:
 Patients will be randomized at each center with separate random number lists into one of the two treatment groups using a computer-generated table numerically corresponding with the treatment group. The trial treatment randomization codes will be maintained until the end of the study and will be broken by investigators who were blind to the randomization procedure.
 Manual aspiration Manual aspiration will be performed as follows: patients were seated in semi-supine position. After skin disinfection and field preparation, a small-caliber pig-tail catheter (6-10 French) will be introduced after local anesthesia with 2% lidocaine in the second intercostal space, at the midclavicular line. After the catheter enters the pleural space, the catheter will be fixed to the skin using sterile adhesive tape and connected via a three-way valve to a 50-ml syringe. Air will be manually aspirated, until a resistance was felt and air was no longer aspirated. Thereafter, a chest X-ray will be performed with the catheter in place.
 Minocycline pleurodesis In the minocycline group, 30 mL of 1% lidocaine hydrochloride (300mg) followed by a solution of 30 mL of normal saline containing 300 mg of minocycline (Mirosin®,
 Taiwan Panbiotic Laboratories, Kaohsiung, Taiwan) will be instilled into the pleural cavity through the pig-tail catheter or chest tube. In the observation group, nothing will be administered. Administration of other chemical pleurodesis agents is prohibited during the study period. Intramuscular meperidine hydrochloride (Demerol®, 50mg/ampule) will be administered every 4 to 6 hours according to the patient's request if the pain became intolerable, could not be relieved by oral analgesics, and visual analogue scale was greater than 7. Chest radiography will be performed immediate postoperatively or the next morning.
 VAS will be evaluated immediately 6 hours later after minocycline administration.
 Study Endpoints:
 The primary end point will be rate of ipsilateral recurrence after the procedure. Secondary end points include safety, early results, and long-term effects of minocycline pleurodesis.
 Immediate success rates: defined as complete or nearly complete and persistent lung expansion immediately following manual aspiration. Immediate success for chest tube drainage is defined as complete lung expansion, absence of air leakage, and chest drain removal within 24 hours after catheter placement.
 One weeks success rates are defined as complete and persistent lung expansion at one weeks after the first attempt of aspiration or tube insertion.
 One-year success: absence of recurrent pneumothorax during a 1-year follow-up period. .
 Safety assessments:
 Safety assessments will consist of monitoring and recording all toxicity, adverse events, safety laboratory examination, vital signs, physical examination. The adverse events which are not reported will be graded as mild, moderate, severe, and life-threatening. Adverse event will be tabulated and the incidence rates will be calculated.
 Sample size estimation:
 A sample size of 300 patients (150 in each group) will be needed to reach clinical significance (at the .05 level with a power of 0.9) if minocycline reduced the recurrence rate from 30% to 15% and the drop out rate is 10%. A planned interim analysis will be conducted after enrollment of 150 patients with at least 12 months of follow-up. Statistical analysis will be performed on an intent-to-treat basis rather than in an actual treatment basis.
 Follow-up After discharge from the hospital, patients will be followed at the outpatient clinics at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months where chest radiography will be performed.
 Follow-ups will then be conducted every 6 months by a registered nurse who is blinded to the group allocation by telephone conversation, according to a standard questionnaire that included when the patient returns to work or school, whether a recurrence occurred, when it happened, and how it is treated. Residual postoperative chest pain will be evaluated on a pain score from 0 to 5, where 0 is pain free; 1 is occasional discomfort; 2 is occasional use of analgesics; 3 is using nonopiate analgesics; 4 is regular pain using opiates; 5 is severe and intractable pain. All patients will be followed for at least 12 months. Patients can come back to the clinic or visit emergency department whenever they have chest pain, dyspnea, or any signs related to the recurrence of pneumothorax.
 Pulmonary function analysis Pulmonary function tests will be performed for patients able to attend a hospital outpatient appointment at least 6 months after surgery. Forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1.0) will be measured using a spirometer of Microspiro HI-298 (Chest Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) with the patients seated. A minimum of three acceptable forced expiratory maneuvers will be performed and the best one will be selected for analysis.
 Data collection and statistical analysis The clinical data, duration of chest drainage, length of hospital stay, complications, requested doses of meperidine, and data of VAS will be collected. Continuous variables such as age or weight will be expressed as the mean + standard deviation and analyzed by the two sample t-test. Categorical variables such as gender or smoking status will be presented by frequency (%) and analyzed by the Fisher's exact test. Intensity of postoperative pain measured by VAS (from 0 to 10) were summarized by mean (95 percent confidence interval) and compared by Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Scores of residual chest pain will be analyzed by the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Freedom from recurrence will be analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method, and comparisons will be made by the log-rank test.

 Cerebrovascular disease, the third leading cause of death after heart disease and cancer in developed countries, has an overall prevalence of 794 per 100,000. In the United States, it is estimated that more than 400,000 patients are discharged each year from hospitals after a stroke. The loss of these patients from the work force and the extended hospitalization they require during recovery make serious economic impact. In Taiwan, Cerebrovascular disease is the second cause of death."

 Both bolus and continuous infusions were found to effectively reduce the LPS-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine TNFα in piglets. When AP was administered as a bolus (160 U/kg), the reduction of TNFα after administration of 10 μg/kg LPS in piglets was found to be in the order of 32%. When 100 U/kg of CIAP was administered as an infusion over 50 minutes, reaching steady state levels of 400 U/L, the reduction in TNFα after LPS challenge was substantially (70%), as compared to TNFα levels after LPS only. A series of these studies demonstrated that dosages of 100-120 U/kg administered over 50 minutes could effectively reduce LPS toxicity at steady state levels around 400 U/L, about a 10 fold of the normal alkaline phosphatase plasma levels (40 U/L in piglets). Furthermore, it is estimated that the above-mentioned dosages can effectively detoxify 10 μg LPS/kg in piglets, which represents an LPS-equivalent derived from about 1010 colony forming units (cfu) of E.coli. These amounts of circulating bacteria are not easily established in a sepsis patient. It is estimated (personal communication, Prof. S. van Deventer, Academic Medical Centre, Amsterdam) that the bacterial load in these patients is less than 107 bacteria total, which is equivalent to approx. 2x105 cfu/kg.
 In summary, in piglets 160 U/kg AP was able to detoxify an amount of LPS equivalent to 1010 cfu E. Coli/kg, which is approximately 50,000 times the expected amount of bacteria in sepsis patients. We therefore expect that the dosage used in human (200 U/kg) administered over 24 hours is able to detoxify the amount of LPS present in sepsis patients. This dosage will result in 5-times normal plasma level of alkaline phosphatase which was well tolerated during the previous clinical trials. Since the effect of antibiotic treatment is expected to occur within hours of administration we decided to establish this steady state level of AP as fast as possible, which explains the initial bolus-like administration by short infusion, followed by a prolonged steady state infusion."

 AAT deficiency is a genetic disorder in which individuals have inadequate levels of the AAT protein. AAT protects the lungs from white blood cell enzymes that can damage air sacs within the lungs, potentially leading to emphysema. Experimental gene transfer procedures, in which normal copies of genes are inserted into cells, are being developed to treat many genetic diseases, including AAT deficiency. In this study, a modified virus, adeno-associated virus (AAV), has been genetically engineered to contain a normal copy of the AAT gene. When AAV is combined with the AAT gene, the resulting agent, Recombinant Adeno-Associated Virus Alpha 1-Antitrypsin (rAAV1-CB-hAAT) Gene Vector with a chicken beta actin promoter (CB), may be able to carry normal copies of the AAT gene into muscle cells with the expectation that additional AAT would be produced. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of injecting rAAV1-CB-hAAT into individuals with AAT deficiency.
 This 14-month study will enroll individuals with AAT deficiency. Participants currently using
 AAT protein replacement will discontinue its use for 19 weeks during the study. Participants will first attend a baseline study visit, which will include a medical history review; a physical examination; an electrocardiogram (ECG) to record heart activity; blood, urine, and semen collection; pulmonary function tests; and chest and arm scans. Participants will then attend a 5-day inpatient visit, during which they will receive a series of injections consisting of one of four different doses of rAAV1-CB-hAAT. Physical examinations will occur on all 5 inpatient days; pulmonary function testing, arm circumference measurements, and collection of blood, urine, and semen will occur on selected days of the inpatient stay.
 Follow-up study visits, with possible overnight stays, will occur on Days 14 and 90. On Days 30, 45, 60, 75, 180, 270, and 365, participants will have blood drawn at a local clinic. On these same days, study staff will contact participants by telephone to review their medical history and symptoms. Unused blood and semen samples will be frozen and stored for future research purposes. Participants will have yearly follow-up evaluations by either telephone or mail for a total of 5 years."
NCT00430417,360062,2018-10-25T00:00:00Z,Clinical Trial Description,360062,AACT,"
 Pregnancy and lactation are both states of altered maternal calcium and bone metabolism which may have a significant impact on the development of peak bone mass. While these two states are characterized by different hormonal environments, both have been associated with significant bone loss. The maternal hormonal mechanism for providing calcium to meet the needs of the developing fetus appear to differ from those that meet the needs of lactation.
 During pregnancy, the 30 gm of calcium required by the fetus comes predominantly from an increase in maternal intestinal calcium absorption which is mediated by 1, 25 dihydroxy vitamin D and other factors. Several studies have measured total and free 1, 25 dihydroxy vitamin D through pregnancy and find the values nearly double. Serum Parathyroid Hormone (PTH) levels fall to about 10-30% of the mean non-pregnant value in the first trimester and then increase to the mid-normal range by term, while ionized calcium remains normal throughout pregnancy. PTHrP levels gradually increase throughout pregnancy although the source (maternal, fetal, or placental) remains unclear. Most studies of bone metabolism in humans during pregnancy have measured changes in markers of bone turnover rather than bone density to avoid radiation exposure to the fetus. These studies have been confounded by several variables such as the effects of hemodilution in pregnancy, altered glomerular filtration rates (GFR), degradation, and clearance of markers by the placenta, which may cloud the results. Some of these studies report an increase in urinary markers of bone resorption from early to mid pregnancy while bone formation markers decrease and then rise before term. Importantly, no one has assessed state-of-the-art markers of bone formation such as P1NP in pregnancy or lactation.
 During lactation in humans, it is estimated that 600 to 1000 ml of milk are produced a day with daily calcium loss of 200 to 400 mg. In contrast to pregnancy, a majority of this calcium comes from demineralization of the maternal skeleton, and is probably predominately mediated by PTHrP in the setting of low estrogen. PTHrP levels are significantly higher in lactating women than non-lactating controls while intact PTH is reduced by approximately 50% during the first several months of lactation. The source of the PTHrP is likely the mammary gland, as PTHrP levels are elevated 10,000 fold in milk and circulating maternal PTHrP levels are increased further with suckling. This is also supported by a mouse model in which the tissue-specific ablation of the PTHrP gene in the lactating mammary gland resulted is a decrease in bone loss during lactation. When PTHrP enters the maternal circulation, it stimulates maternal bone resorption from the skeleton and renal tubular resorption of calcium. PTHrP indirectly suppresses PTH as ionized calcium rises to upper levels of normal. 1, 25 dihydroxy vitamin D levels fall to within the normal range during lactation, although they have been reported to be higher in lactating than non-lactating postpartum women.
 Intestinal absorption of calcium also returns to normal during the post-partum period. Serial bone density measurement obtained during lactation show a fall of 3-10% in trabecular bone (spine, hip, femur) with a smaller 1-2% loss at cortical bone. Both losses are far greater that than that seen in early postmenopausal women, or in women receiving gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist therapy. This implies that it is not only the fall in estrogen that mediates bone loss during lactation. The bone loss during lactation seems to be transient as there is rapid recovery of bone density in postpartum women with weaning and the resumption of menses.
 Markers of bone resorption have been measured in urine in several prospective studies of lactation in humans where they have been reported to be elevated 2-3 fold. However, these results may be confounded by a decrease in GFR and volume contraction that may occur during lactation compared to pregnancy. Surprisingly, more reliable markers of bone resorption measured in serum (CTX and NTX) have not been measured in a controlled lactation study.
 Markers of bone formation as measured by osteocalcin (Oc) and bone specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP) have generally been reported to be higher during lactation. However, these results are difficult to interpret as BSAP is not a very sensitive marker of bone formation.
 Recent data has emerged suggesting that Oc may measure bone resorption as well as formation.
 The current most accurate measure of bone formation is serum amino-terminal telopeptides of procollagen 1 (P1NP), which has not been measured in a control study of lactating women.
 This is a prospective pilot cohort study of post-partum lactating women, post-partum non-lactating women, and matched healthy controls who are not currently or have not recently been pregnant. The investigators hope to estimate the measurable differences in bone formation and resorption by comparing blood and urine samples from lactating women to non-lactating postpartum women and normal controls. 100 female volunteers between the ages of 21 and 45 years will be recruited to achieve 75 evaluable subjects or 25 in each of the three groups. There are two study visits, one at 6-8 weeks and another at 12-14 weeks postpartum.
 Normal controls will be seen during the follicular phase of their menstrual cycle and they will be age and race matched to the post-partum women."

 We believe that the risks of allogeneic transplant can be drastically reduced if the following criteria can be met: (1) consistent engraftment, (2) little or no GVHD with the ability to rapidly withdraw immune suppression, (3) rapid recovery of CD4 counts to levels greater than 200 cells/micro liter. Our prior (ongoing) trial attempts to address how LLME treated T cells given as donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) can address points 2 and 3 above.
 The current study addresses how treatment of the CD34- fraction of the graft attempts to address points 1 and 2 (and to a lesser extent point 3) above. We believe that if these points can be consistently achieved that the mortality of allogeneic HSCT may be reduced to levels more akin to those of autologous HSCT. We propose to test the hypothesis that
 LLME-treated T cells will be safe with regard to reducing GVHD or other infusion related toxicities and that their administration as part of the transplant will facilitate engraftment. We believe that this approach will ultimately be an important step in a variety of transplant settings ranging from matched siblings to haplodisparate donors."

 Cerebral palsy (CP) is a constellation of symptoms and conditions defined as lifelong motor dysfunction resulting rom a non-progressive brain lesion occurring pre-, peri- or postnatal before the second year of life. CP consists of different aspect of motor disorder including spasticity, paresis, incoordination and dystonia
 There is scarce knowledge about the association between spasticity, pain and physical function in the adult CP-population, and the systematic follow up of patients with CP typically ends at the age of eighteen. Frequently used intervention in spastic cerebral palsy for children with gait problems are injections with Botulinum toxin type A (Btx-A) in leg and thigh muscles, and three dimensional-gait analysis has become a standard procedure in treatment decision and evaluation.
 Botulinum toxin A (Btx- A) is a highly effective treatment in the management of spasticity.
 The first reported success of use of Btx-A in children with cerebral palsy was made in 1993 by Koman et al. Subsequently, randomized controlled studies on children with spastic type of cerebral palsy has documented that Btx-A is effective and safe in the management of muscle spasticity in children with CP. There is an implicit, and as of yet, unproven assumption that there is no indication for this treatment in the adult CP-population."

 Cardiovascular disease (CVD), including congestive heart failure (CHF), accounts for over 75% of deaths among patients with diabetes. Thus, it is imperative to rigorously evaluate existing and emerging hypoglycemic therapies with regard to their cardiovascular consequences. The thiazolidinedione (TZD) class of drugs, alone or in combination with other oral hypoglycemic medications or with insulin, has emerged as a safe and effective treatment of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes. Both in vitro and in vivo studies have revealed favorable pleiotropic effects of TZD on myocyte and ventricular structure and function.
 However, approximately 10% of patients taking TZDs develop peripheral edema and some patients have developed heart failure decompensation on the drug. These observations have led to a
 Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warning regarding the use of TZDs in patients with or at high risk of developing congestive heart failure (CHF). The exact effects of TZDs on integrated cardiovascular performance remain unclear. The primary hypothesis of this study is that TZD treatment improves integrated cardiovascular performance in patients at risk for CHF by improving both central (i.e. cardiac output) and peripheral (i.e. vascular resistance) function.
 Recently, we have developed a sensitive, reproducible noninvasive assay to measure intra-cardiomyocyte fat, which varies widely in amount between individuals. The relationship between the amount of cardiomyocyte triglyceride accumulation and LV mass and function remains unclear. TZDs have been previously shown to be associated with decreases in the TG content of the liver and muscle. The secondary hypothesis being tested in this study is that
 TZD treatment improves cardiac function by decreasing intra-cardiac myocyte triglyceride content.
 Comparisons:
 -  Peak oxygen uptake (VO2) during cardiopulmonary exercise testing in individuals randomized to rosiglitazone, compared to those on placebo.
 -  Amount of intra-myocardial triglycerides using NMR techniques in in individuals randomized to rosiglitazone, compared to those on placebo."

 Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infects approximately 170 million people worldwide. About 10-50% of persons with HCV have MC. MC is associated with the development of autoimmune symptoms and B cell proliferative disorders. We plan to study B cells from individuals chronically infected with HCV as well as from healthy controls. We sort B cells into different types, and we analyze these types for differential levels of gene expression. We are testing the hypothesis that certain types of B cells from subjects with MC have increased expression of genes that allow for increased cell survival.
 People interested in participating in this study will have a complete history and general medical examinations before beginning the study. Following the screening, you will have a procedure called leukapheresis, in which white blood cells are removed, but your own red blood cells are returned. The procedure takes approximately 3 hours and is similar to blood donation. The leukapheresis is done during a same day admission to the hospital by an outside blood collection company with trained nurses and certified equipment.
 Some aspects of this study are experimental which means the fluid and cells collected will be studied and analyzed to determine more precisely how your body's immune system is responding to the virus. These tests are experimental in that they are not part of the usual routine care of patients."

 With prevalence rates (lifetime) up to 13% in western countries, Social Phobia is one of the most frequent mental disorders. Main objective of this clinical trial is the evaluation of the efficacy and efficiency of a stepped care program for patients with Social Phobia (SCP) as compared to a standard therapy (ST) for patients with social phobia. Both interventions are based on the cognitive therapy according to D.M. Clark.
 The SCP starts with a 8-sessions self-help-module with minimal therapist contact via email.
 Patients who do not reach remission after this first step, enter step 2 which consists of 8 therapy sessions guided by a therapist. If patients are not remitted after that, they receive another 8 sessions of therapist-guided cognitive treatment in step 3. So the SCP contains 8, 16 or 24 sessions of therapy - depending on remission status of the patient. In contrast to that, the ST comprises 16 sessions of therapist-guided intervention.
 The diagnostic status of the patients is assessed by blinded clinician raters before treatment, after every eighth therapy session, and at 5 follow-up timepoints in order to examine the stability of treatment effects (3, 6, 9, 12 and 30 months after the end of therapy). Besides efficacy and efficiency of the SCP vs. ST, mechanisms of change and differential predictors for therapy outcome will be investigated.
 Hypotheses: We expect that 1. the SCP is significantly more effective than the ST. 2. the SCP is significantly more efficient than the ST. 3. the results referring to the efficacy will be stable up to 30 months after the end of treatment(Follow Up Phase). 4. the SCP will cause less primary and secondary costs than the ST. 5. successful therapy leads to an improvement in the following areas:
 -  reduction of biased information processing,
 -  reduction of negative thoughts, subjective anxiety, safety behaviors, self-focused attention and autonomic arousal in anxiety-provoking situations,
 -  amelioration of verbal and non-verbal social competence in anxiety- provoking situations.
 As mediators of change, the factors maintaining social anxiety according to the model of

 Up to now there is no fully functional and precise technique for accurate assessment for monitoring the degree of unconsciousness during general anaesthesia. Previous studies and results obtained during the project regarding the effect of anaesthetics on single neurons and small neuronal networks indicate that it would be most promising to use a method directly correlating to the integrity of the relevant functional systems. As one goal of the project it was formulated to develop and test a new system for recording and analysis of mid latency auditory evoked potentials (MLAEP), suitable to be used in the clinical surrounding of an operation theatre. Step by step an investigational system was developed, that after obtaining legal approvement was functional in a broad spectrum of cases. In a multicenter study the including 4 clinical centres and 426 patients the reliability of the system was proved. Even under the hard conditions of the OR the apparatus was able to record the signals with sufficient reliability and precision. A clear correlation of MLAEP parameters with clinically defined states of consciousness could be identified. Differences in the effect of the used combinations of general anaesthetics and opioids were identified. An algorithm for automatic analysis of the signals was developed, to allow users with limited knowledge of interpretation of MLAEP signals to use them for monitoring anaesthesia."

 Middle-ear (ME) pressure is a measure of the number of contained gas moles, and processes that addd or remove gas moles from the relatively fixed volume ME cavity change its pressure.
 Experimental results from animal studies document significant gas exchange across the tympanic membrane and if confirmed for humans may explain some of the paradoxical findings for children with poor Eustachian tube function such as the preservation of an aerated ME when the normal routes of gas supply are disrupted. This study measures the rates of reactive and inert gas exchange across the adult tympanic membrane with and without structural abnormalities and determines if these transfers are purely diffusive phenomena. The resulting data will be used to develop species-specific rate-constants that will be used as parameters in modeling ME pressure regulation."

 SIGNIFICANCE AND BACKGROUND FOR THE STUDY The benefits of dual anti-platelet therapy with full dose aspirin and a thienopyridine have been firmly established in patients undergoing coronary stenting. Leon showed reduction in the combined end-point of death, myocardial infarction, target vessel revascularization and stent thrombosis from 3.5% with aspirin alone to 2.3% with aspirin and ticlopidine. This benefit was associated, however, with an increased rate of bleeding and vascular complications of 5.5% with aspirin+ticlopidine versus 1.8% with aspirin alone. Multiple other studies have evaluated the safety and efficacy of the thienopyridine clopidogrel in percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). In patients at intermediate risk (without elevation of troponin-T prior to PCI), pretreatment with clopidogrel several hours before the procedure reduced the event rate and obviated the need for additional glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor inhibition (ISAR-REACT). In the Clopidogrel for the Reduction of Events During Observation (CREDO) Study, investigators showed that the benefit of pretreatment with 300 mg of clopidogrel was only seen when the pretreatment was instituted at least 12 hours pre-procedure (optimally 24 hours before the PCI). However, survival analysis in this study showed a cumulative event rate at 30 days of 8.3% in the placebo arm, 7.8% in those administered clopidogrel within 15 hours of the procedure, and 3.5% in those administered clopidogrel more that 15 hours before the index PCI.
 Subsequently, the benefit of higher doses of clopidogrel was studied both ex vivo and in clinical studies (PRONTO). A 600 mg dose of clopidogrel achieved adequate platelet inhibition within 2 hours of administration, unlike 300 mg that required at least 3 to 6 hours to achieve full effect Subsequent data from the ISAR-REACT investigators in 2,159 patients showed that the benefit of 600 mg of clopidogrel was not time dependent. The trial focused on the possible additional benefit of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibition in these patients who had all been pre-treated with 600 mg of clopidogrel. More recently, ISAR-REACT-2 showed that clopidogrel pretreatment in moderate to high risk PCI patients reduced the combined endpoint event rate (relative to placebo) from 11.7% to 5.7% in patients treated with glycoprotein
 IIb/IIIa inhibitors and from 15.5% to 7.6% in those not receiving glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibition. The recently published Assessment of the Best Loading Dose of Clopidogrel to
 Blunt Platelet Activation, Inflammation and Ongoing Necrosis (ALBION) Trial showed in a low risk group of patients that 600 mg and 900 mg doses of clopidogrel provide faster and greater platelet inhibition than 300 mg as assessed by biochemical assays. The study was underpowered to demonstrate clinical benefits, but it showed a trend towards reduction in troponin-I release as a marker of necrosis from 58% to 42% in the higher dose clopidogrel groups. There was no demonstrable increase in major bleeding complications (2.9% in both 300 and 900 mg groups), but there was a statistically insignificant increase in minor bleeding in the 900 mg dose group.
 Our investigation will evaluate the safety and efficacy of pre-treatment (≥2 hours) with 600 mg of clopidogrel in 600 outpatients undergoing elective cardiac catheterization with coronary angiography in our institution who have no evidence of high risk features such as ischemic ST segment deviations, unstable angina, recent myocardial infarction, or abnormal troponin-T levels. The benefit of clopidogrel in patients who undergo interventions may be offset by the bleeding complications encountered, especially in patients who do not undergo coronary angioplasty. Our trial is designed to assess this potential benefit-risk trade-off.
 Unlike the ALBION trial, we will focus on clinical outcomes using a larger sample size. Our hypothesis is that pretreatment with 600 mg of clopidogrel will significantly reduce the incidence of ischemic complications in patients undergoing PCI, but with possible increase in hemorrhagic and vascular complications in the overall population.
 In addition, we will also examine whether the use of 5 French arterial sheaths in cases that do not go onto intervention offsets the increase in bleeding risk, if any, associated with pretreatment with 600 mg of clopidogrel. Very large diameter arterial sheaths (e.g., 10
 French) have been associated with higher vascular complication rates, but whether 5 French sheaths offer lower vascular complication rates than 6 French sheaths is uncertain. Nearly all PCIs at our institution are performed using 6 French sheaths (which have larger lumens, more accommodating of angioplasty equipment and higher injection rates of iodinated contrast). Patients who undergo PCI following diagnostic angiography using a 5 French sheath will require exchange for a larger 6 French arterial sheath. On the other hand, patients who do not need angioplasty after coronary angiography will not require any exchange of their arterial sheath, and those with smaller sheath sizes may well have less vascular and bleeding complications.
 DESCRIPTION OF RESEARCH PROTOCOL Design: This is a prospective randomized clinical trial comparing ischemic, hemorrhagic and vascular outcomes in outpatients undergoing elective cardiac catheterization with coronary angiography following 1:1 randomization to pretreatment with 600 mg clopidogrel vs. no pretreatment (and clopidogrel dosing post-procedure if a PCI is performed). Patients will provide written informed consent prior to enrollment and randomization. Since some operators may feel strongly about using glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibition in patients who did not receive clopidogrel well in advance of the PCI, blinding of the loading strategy and use of a placebo are not feasible. A separate 1:1 randomization will assign patients to undergo cardiac catheterization using 5 or 6 French arterial introducing sheaths. Since the arterial sheath sizes are color-coded, catheter sizes are imprinted on each catheter, and the operator must know the arterial sheath size in case alternate catheters are required, blinding of sheath size assignment is also not feasible.
 The investigator adjudicating and abstracting the outcomes data such as bleeding and ischemic complications for analysis will be blinded, however, to the clopidogrel reimen and randomization in order to avoid any bias.
 Hypotheses to be tested: The primary hypothesis being examined is that clopidogrel 600 mg given ≥2 hours prior to cardiac catheterization will reduce the frequency of post-procedural ischemic events in the subset of patients who undergo ad hoc coronary interventions compared with those who do not receive clopidogrel pre-procedure. The risk of hemorrhagic and vascular complications by preloading strategy will be evaluated in all patients randomized (encompassing those who do and those who do not undergo PCI). Additional analyses will be performed to see if the size of the initial arterial introducing sheath also has an effect on the rate of hemorrhagic and vascular complications and if there is any interaction of sheath size with preloading strategy on these outcomes.
 Patient population: All outpatients undergoing elective cardiac catheterization with planned coronary angiography with possible ad hoc PCI (if lesion anatomy suitable) and who have not received clopidogrel or ticlopidine during the 14 days prior to the procedure are eligible.
 Patients with high-risk clinical features, contraindications to clopidogrel, or planned upcoming invasive procedures will be excluded (vide infra).
 Procedural factors: The decision to perform ad hoc PCI after diagnostic coronary angiography (vs. medical therapy or bypass surgery) will be made by the interventional cardiologist performing or overseeing the cardiac catheterization, in consultation with the patient's clinical cardiologists. The specific angioplasty techniques, devices, equipment, anti-thrombin and anti-platelet pharmacological regimen to be utilized are NOT specified by this protocol and are at the discretion of the interventional cardiologist.
 Patients randomized to 5 French arterial sheaths and NO clopidogrel preloading will be allowed to ambulate 2 hours after arterial hemostasis is achieved (with delayed ambulation if bleeding or orthostatic hypotension occurs). All other participants (i.e., 6 French arterial sheaths, or 5 French arterial sheaths with clopidogrel preloading) will be allowed to ambulate no earlier than 4 hours after hemostasis occurs.
 Variables of interest include baseline demographic and clinical characteristics (including age, gender, left ventricular ejection fraction, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, chronic renal insufficiency, serum creatinine level, tobacco use, extent of coronary disease, symptom severity, prior myocardial infarction, prior PCI, prior CABG), angiographic lesion characteristics (e.g., bifurcation location, lesion class), procedural factors (e.g., pharmacological antithrombin regimen, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor use), and post-procedural tests (including serum creatinine, serum creatine kinase and its MB isoform, troponin-T, and radiological imaging studies). Information will be gleaned from the
 Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory Quality Assurance Database, from electronic medical records, from review of the procedural angiograms, and conversations with the patient (or if the patient cannot be located, their family or health care providers).
 Endpoints: All endpoints will be assessed at 14 days post-procedure (and divided for analytical purposes into in-hospital and post-discharge events). See Endpoint section of this document for details.
 Follow-up: Written and electronic medical records will be reviewed to identify clinical events occurring during the hospitalization (through the 1st 14 days post-procedure if the length of stay is prolonged). Participants will have provided written informed consent for clinical follow-up at 14 days post-procedure prior to entry into this study, and contact information for the patient, his/her primary care provider, his/her cardiologist, and his/her next of kin will be collected before discharge. The patient, his/her physicians, or his/her next of kin will be contacted by telephone at 14 or more days post-procedure and asked if the patient was treated after discharge for any heart-related, bleeding, or vascular access site problems (i.e., any of the clinical events detailed above). If yes, attempts will be made, with the patient's authorization, to obtain more information about the event, including requests for documentation from other health care facilities and providers.
 Data Monitoring and Safety Plan: A independent data safety monitoring committee (DSMC) comprised of Murray Mittleman, MD, DrPH (BIDMC cardiovascular epidemiologist, serving as
 Chair), David J. Cohen, MD, MSc (interventional cardiologist at the Mid America Heart
 Institute), and Shiva Gautam, PhD (BIDMC biostatistician) will review the rates of the 4 composite endpoints enumerated above after 14 day follow-up has been completed on the 1st 300 subjects enrolled. The DSMC will advise the principal investigator whether the study should terminated because of concerning and striking differences in the ischemic or vascular/bleeding complication rates between treatment strategies or if the study should be allowed to continue to the planned enrollment of 600 participants. Study recruitment will be suspended during the DSMC's review and deliberations.
 Data Management: Much of the data required for this study is routinely collected as part of current clinical care, quality assurance and regulatory processes and stored in the Cardiac
 Catheterization Laboratory Quality Assurance Database (residing a commercial application named Apollo and manufactured by Lumedx). The fields of interest for patients randomized in this study will be queried form the Apollo database and transferred directly to the Access database that serves as the primary electronic data repository for this study. This database will be housed on a network server within the BIDMC firewall with restricted access (password and valid user identification required). Additional information (from medical records or patient contacts) will be collected on paper case report forms prior to entry into the Access database. All case report forms and paper clinical information with patient identifiers will be stored in a locked file drawer within a locked office. Angiograms will be reviewed using clinical workstations in physically secured areas, and electronic copies of angiograms will be made with all patient identifiers electronically removed. Medical record numbers and names will be removed prior to creation of final analytical dataset. All paper and electronic information will be destroyed in a HIPAA-compliant fashion after completion and publication of this study.
 Statistical Considerations Randomization: A randomization scheme will be prepared using 1:1:1:1 ratios (for the 2 clopidogrel dosing strategies combined independently with 5 vs. 6
 French arterial sheaths) with permuted blocks of random sizes of 4 or 8. The treatment assignment will be designated in opaque, tamper-resistant randomization envelopes provided by the Statistical Department of the Harvard Clinical Research Institute.
 Statistical Analysis: All statistical analyses will be performed using SAS for Windows v9.
 The primary analysis will compare the cumulative incidence at 14 days of the primary composite endpoint (any death, myocardial infarction, or myocardial necrosis) in patients with PCI attempted between those randomized to clopidogrel loading vs. those randomized to standard clopidogrel administration using the Fisher's exact test. A p value of 0.05 or less will be required for statistical significance. The secondary endpoint of stent thrombosis among those who undergo stent deployment will also be evaluated using Fisher's exact test.
 The other endpoints (including vascular and bleeding) will be examined in all patients randomized (and not just subsets who had PCI attempted or stents deployed). Two group comparisons (clopidogrel loading vs. standard dosing; 5 French vs. 6 French arterial sheaths) and 4 group comparisons (the 4 combinations of clopidogrel dosing strategy and arterial sheath size; or subgroups with PCI or no PCI by clopidogrel dosing strategy) will be performed using Fisher's exact test, t-tests, ANOVA, or analogous non-parametric tests as appropriate. Since multiple exploratory analyses will be performed, p-values for everything other than the primary analysis delineated above must be interpreted with caution. Logistical regression models will also be constructed to identify pre-procedural predictors of ischemic and of bleeding or vascular complications."

 Because resources are often scarce in the aftermath of disasters, a useful mental health intervention is one that is effective, feasible, rapidly available, and efficiently delivered to the largest proportion of affected individuals possible. In terms of treating PTSD in other trauma contexts, there is considerable evidence that cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) procedures are effective at reducing the array of PTSD symptoms. Overall, the available evidence points to the theoretical and empirical justification for using Prolonged Exposure (PE) and Stress Inoculation Training (SIT), two components of CBT, with patients presenting with PTSD. A practical limitation of available studies is that they are limited to individually administered therapy contexts that typically require between 8 and 12 sessions delivered in a specialty mental health care-setting. The labor-intensive nature of these therapies represents a significant obstacle to provision of therapy to potentially thousands of individuals suffering PTSD in the context of mass violence events.
 The major aim of this project is to evaluate an abbreviated format of SIT that aims to provide effective self/stress-management skills to individuals with PTSD. The rationale behind this intervention is that with appropriate and intensive therapist input during a single session of therapy, supplemented systematically with self-paced and self-directed homework, promoted, prompted, and monitored via a specialized web-site and augmented by therapist feedback and guidance delivered via the web, primary care patients with PTSD stemming from mass violence can benefit from the strategies that have demonstrated efficacy in reducing PTSD symptoms. Survivors of the Pentagon attack on 9/11 who present at primary care clinics that serve the Pengaton are randomly assigned to SIT or a supportive counseling control group. Patients’ compliance and symptoms are monitored on the web and via clinical interview."

 The Study Drug:
 CEP-701 is designed to help prevent a certain type of molecule (called a mutated JAK2 receptor) that is found on myelofibrosis cells from sending continuous chemical signals that lead to the growth of cancer cells.
 Study Treatment:
 If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will take CEP-701 by mouth (in liquid form) 2 times a day (once in the morning and once in the evening) every day in 30-day repeating cycles. You should take each dose about 12 hours apart.
 The study doctor or nurse will teach you and/or a caregiver or family member how to prepare each dose of the study drug, as well as how much should be taken each time. At each study visit, you will be supplied with enough syringes, dosing cups, and study drug to last until your next study visit. For each dose, you will use the syringe to draw the proper amount of
 CEP-701. You will add the entire contents of the syringe to an approved juice in 1 of the provided dosing cups. You should also drink an additional dosing cup of juice after taking the drug dose. The following juices (100% juice only) are approved for use with CEP-701: grape, pineapple, apple, V8 vegetable juice, and orange juice.
 The study drug mixture may be stored (in an areas that are protected from light, such as in a cabinet) for up to 1 hour at room temperature and up to 8 hours refrigerated (at about 35°F to 45 °F). If you miss a dose, you should not take another dose until your next scheduled dose.
 Study Visits:
 You will initially have study visits at M. D. Anderson once a month. You will need to return monthly for 6 months, then every 3 months if there are no side effects during the previous 3 cycles. After 2 years of therapy, your visits can be extended to every 6 months. After 6 cycles you may have either a study visit or a phone call from a member of study staff. If you have a phone call, you will be asked how you are feeling, if you have experienced any side effects since your last visit, and your blood tests will be reviewed with you. During most study visits, you will have the following tests:
 -  You will have a physical exam.
 -  You will be asked how you are feeling and about any side effects you may have experienced since your last visit.
 -  You will have blood (about 2 tablespoons) drawn to check your kidney and liver function and blood cell count. This will be done every 2 weeks up to 3 months, then every 1-2 months.
 -  You will have a bone marrow/aspirate once every 3-6 months to see if you are responding to treatment. After 2 years of therapy, this can be extended to every 12 months.
 Length of Study:
 You will continue on this study for at least 6 months to allow time for response. If you do respond to study treatment, you may continue to receive cycles for up to 5 years.
 If you do not respond to study treatment within 6 months, if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, if you have an illness that keeps you from taking the study drug, or your doctor thinks it is in your best interest to stop taking part in this study, you will be taken off this study.
 This is an investigational study. CEP-701 is not Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved or commercially available. At this time, it is being used for research purposes only in this study. Up to 41 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D.

NCT00494208,356785,2018-10-25T00:00:00Z,Clinical Trial Description,356785,AACT,"
 In healthy women the primary hormones produced by the ovaries are estrogens and progesterone, but they also produce testosterone both before and after menopause. Although normal blood levels of testosterone in women are much lower than in men, testosterone is thought to have important physiologic effects in women, particularly on muscle function, body composition, sexual function and cognitive function. When women require bilateral oophorectomy (removal of ovaries), they subsequently have a significant drop in serum testosterone levels. They also frequently experience a decreased sense of well being, and decreased sexual function.
 While treatment with testosterone and other androgens has been widely promoted for women with low serum levels, there is little available data on the effects of such treatment particularly when given in physiologic doses (doses resulting in normal blood levels for women). Studies that have demonstrated benefits of testosterone in women have often used doses of testosterone which resulted in higher than normal serum testosterone levels. At such doses, testosterone and other androgens can produce virilizing side effects such as increased facial and body hair, acne, increased size of the clitoris and changes in the voice.
 It is not known whether physiologic testosterone replacement can provide the benefits seen with higher doses in women with androgen deficiency without the limiting, virilizing side effects. It has been assumed that testosterone dose-response relationships are different in women than in men, and that clinically significant effects on psycho-sexual function, body composition, muscle performance, cognitive function, and other health-related outcomes can be achieved at testosterone doses and concentrations that are substantially lower than those required to produce similar effects in men; however, these assumptions have not been tested rigorously.
 Therefore, the primary objective of this study is to establish testosterone dose-response relationships in surgically menopausal women with low testosterone concentrations for a range of androgen-dependent outcomes, including sexual function, fat-free mass, thigh muscle strength and leg power, several domains of neurocognitive function, plasma lipids, apolipoproteins and lipoprotein particles, and insulin sensitivity.
 The secondary objective is to determine the range of testosterone doses and subsequent plasma testosterone concentrations that are associated with improvements in sexual, physical and neurocognitive functions and that can be safely administered to women without significant adverse effects on hair growth, voice, sebum production, clitoral size, and cardiovascular risk factors.
 Hypotheses 1. Testosterone administration in surgically menopausal women with low testosterone concentrations is associated with dose- and concentration-dependent improvements in sexual function and sexual activity scores, specific domains of cognitive function, fat-free mass, thigh muscle strength, and leg power. 2. Testosterone dose-response relationships are different for different androgen dependent processes. While some domains of sexual function are normalized by testosterone concentrations at the upper end of the normal range for healthy, young women, significant gains in fat-free mass, thigh muscle strength and power would require higher testosterone doses than those required to induce changes in sexual function."

 BACKGROUND There is good evidence from multiple sites, including in Ghana, that malaria is massively over-diagnosed. It could be argued that where microscopy is not available it can be introduced, and elsewhere it can be improved, but high-quality microscopy is not easy to sustain. If substantial over-diagnosis continues in Ghana in an era where an ACT is now the first-line treatment, it will lead to the intervention being substantially more expensive due to over-prescription than it should be, potentially rendering it unsustainable.
 The introduction of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) has the potential to provide a way of more accurately directing ACTs to those that need them and may also encourage clinicians to consider alternative diagnoses in test-negative cases, reducing the risk of missing treatable, and potentially fatal, alternative causes of febrile illness. RDTs to direct ACT use also have the possibility to be cost-effective, but only if clinicians prescribe logically on the basis of test results.
 Initial data from Tanzania suggests that providing RDTs in the context of formal healthcare settings may have little impact on clinician behaviour, but the health system in Ghana is very different, and both clinician and patient beliefs about malaria are likely to be different.
 Additionally, this has not been properly tested in areas with little or no access to microscopy, nor where ACTs are currently available, which may influence clinician behaviour.
 Many believe this is the most useful setting for RDTs, and may limit over-prescription of anti-malarials but there are no data to support this belief, nor are there data on the cost-effectiveness of this approach. This trial aims to test the impact of RDT use on clinician behaviour directly by means of a randomised trial.
 OBJECTIVES Principal Objective To determine by means of a randomized trial the impact of the introduction of Rapid Diagnostic Tests (RDTs) on the appropriate prescription of anti-malarials in the two public healthcare settings found in Ghana.
 Specifically, 1. To determine by means of a randomized trial the impact of introducing RDTs on the appropriate prescription of anti-malarials in a setting where diagnosis is currently purely clinical. 2. To determine by means of a randomized trial the impact of introducing RDTs on the appropriate prescription of anti-malarials in a setting where microscopy is available. 3. To determine the sensitivity and specificity of RDTs in the diagnosis of malaria. 4. To explore clinician and patient perceptions on the use of RDTs versus clinical diagnosis in the management of malaria. 5. To explore clinician and patient perceptions on the use of RDTs versus microscopy in the management of malaria. 6. To determine the cost-effectiveness of RDTs for diagnosis of malaria in both settings.
 In both cases RDT is being compared to the standard of care in the health centre.
 METHODS The study will be carried out in the Dangme West District in the southern part of
 Ghana. It will be an individually randomized controlled trial 1. Baseline data will initially be collected for a period of one month to document the normal pattern of diagnosing malaria by clinicians in each health facility. At the health centre, all patients for whom microscopy is requested will have a research slide taken at the same time and the laboratory results of the clinic slide documented. 2. Exit interviews with patients and record reviews will be conducted to find out whether patients had been prescribed an anti-malarial and confirm whether this was done on clinical grounds or on the basis of microscopy. Their prescriptions will be documented.
 At the community clinics as well, a research slide will be taken for all patients with diagnosis of malaria or who are prescribed an anti-malarial. Record review of the outpatient department (OPD) cards of all patients with a diagnosis of malaria or who receive an anti-malarial be carried out to also document presenting symptoms. 3. For the main trial, all patients visiting the health facility and who meet the inclusion criteria will be eligible for enrolment into the study. Allocations to either microscopy or RDT at the health centre and to either clinical diagnosis or RDT at the community clinics will be computer generated. The allocations will be placed in sequentially numbered sealed opaque envelopes which will be prior-labelled with unique study ID numbers. Patients will be identified and consent sought on exit from the consulting room. If the clinician requests a laboratory test, the patient will be sent to the laboratory where a research assistant will open the sealed envelope in the presence of the patient to find out their allocation. The allocated test will be carried out and a research slide taken at the same time. The lab results will be written out as usual in the case of microscopy and the dipstick results will be recorded and sent to the clinician for reading as well. 4. At the community clinics where there is no laboratory, the process of identification of eligible patients, seeking of consent and allocation of study arm will be similar to that of the health centre. However, in this setting, depending on the allocation in the sealed envelope, a rapid diagnostic test will either be carried out by a research assistant or a printed card with clinical diagnosis written on it will be given to the patient. In the case of the RDT, the results will be recorded before the dipstick is sent to the clinician for clinician-read diagnosis and subsequent treatment. Whether the patient is assigned to clinical diagnosis or RDT, a research assistant will prepare a research slide per patient and air dry them for later batch reading. 5. The presenting symptoms, temperature at presentation, laboratory results, clinician's diagnoses and treatment of all patients recruited into the study will be documented.
 Prescriptions given to them will be documented on exit. In addition, their contact addresses will be collected on exit and consent sought to facilitate their easy location and recruitment for focus group discussions later. 6. The gold standard for whether a child or adult has malaria will be slide-proven malaria parasitaemia measured by a double-read research slide. Research slides will be Giemsa stained and read by two independent microscopists who would be blind to the study allocations and test results. They will not be used by clinicians in their treatment decisions. 7. At the end of the trial, individual in-depth interviews will be conducted with the main clinicians and focus group discussions held with all the other clinicians of the participating health facilities. The aim will be to explore their perceptions with regard to the use of clinical diagnosis, microscopy and RDT in the diagnosis of malaria and their practices with regards to this. 8. A random selection of patients from the three health facilities will be contacted to participate in focus group discussions at the end of the trial. There will be at least two focus group discussions comprising 8-12 discussants each from each health facility.
 These discussions will be carried out by means of interview guides. The discussions will be conducted in the local language and recorded on a tape recorder.
 In both settings data will be collected for the cost-effectiveness studies."

 The prevalence of obesity has risen to epidemic proportions in the world, resulting from both excessive energy intake and low levels of energy expenditure. The effect of nutrient absorption on energy balance, that is, the relative amount of nutrients consumed vs. the amount excreted in stool, has been reported only in small studies in which energy waste in feces and urine between lean and obese individuals was not found to be different. However, these studies were limited by small sample sizes and were not specifically designed to examine whether stool energy loss varied between lean and obese individuals. In addition, little is known about the reproducibility of the measurements of energy loss in stool and urine. We propose to investigate (i) whether there are significant differences in energy loss (as measured in stool and urine) between obese and lean individuals, and (ii) to examine the reproducibility of these measurements. Because the literature suggests a role for enteric bacterial flora in obesity, we will also examine differences in such flora between these groups. We plan to study 25 obese and 25 lean healthy non-smoking Caucasian men age 18 - 45 years old, not taking any medications (including medications for weight loss, antibiotics or probiotics) for the examination of differences in nutrient energy loss. Of these subjects, 10 lean and 10 obese individuals will be invited to repeat the study to test the reproducibility of these measurements. All participants will be admitted to the Clinical Research Unit for 15 days. During their stay, subjects will be fed a weight maintaining diet for 3 days, followed in a random cross-over design by two experimental diets: a 2400 kcal/d or 3400 kcal/d diet for 3 days. Twenty four-hour urine and feces collections will take place each day of the experimental diet period. The energy content of these waste products as well as that of the diet (using duplicate plate analysis) will be measured by bomb calorimetry. Bacterial components in feces will be extracted by repeated fractional centrifugation to obtain bacterial mass and by using 16S rDNA-based oligonucleotide probes to obtain bacterial flora.
 Primary results will examine the differences in energy loss between lean and obese individuals as well as the reproducibility of the measurements of stool and urine energy content."

 It is well known that chronic pain syndromes are associated with alterations in sleep continuity and sleep architecture. Similarly, recent evidence indicates that sleep deprivation interferes with normal pain perception producing hyperalgesic changes, and with the regular analgesic effects of certain pain drugs (reviewed in Kundermann B et al., 2004).
 However, the role of the nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic agents in pain perception is not well understood. Lunesta (eszopiclone), unlike other nonbenzodiazepine sleep medications, is approved for long-term use (no significant addictive effects of the drug are observed following the treatment of up to 6mo). Its antinociceptive properties have not been examined and, if found, could potentiate the use of this drug for pain control, especially in patients with comorbid chronic pain and insomnia.
 The objective of this proposal is to use Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) with an experimental pain paradigm in a group of chronic insomnia patients. The study will consist of three sessions, the first of which will include questionnaires, and a mental and physical health evaluation including an EKG and blood draw. Following the initial screening session subjects will be randomly assigned to either the study drug or placebo groups, and complete 2 additional identical study sessions using fMRI. The first fMRI session will be before taking the drug/placebo, and the second session will be after taking the study drug/placebo nightly for 1 week. During these fMRI sessions, subjects will undergo psychophysical testing of their sensitivity to warmth and heat and will rate various temperatures for pain intensity and pain unpleasantness. Subjects will also complete additional tasks including motor inhibition and face matching during scanning."

 Background and Significance:
 Warfarin is usually prescribed to manage long-term anticoagulation of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). However about 5% of patients are unable to tolerate warfarin or to be safely or effectively anticoagulated. Some of the reasons for discontinuing warfarin anticoagulation and switching patients to parenteral anticoagulation are as follows: 1. Recurrent venous thromboembolism despite anticoagulation with warfarin 2. Clinically important bleeding complications due to warfarin 3. Inability to achieve target International Normalized Ratio (INR) on warfarin 4. Nonbleeding side effects of warfarin, such as hair loss or rash.
 These patients who cannot tolerate or respond adequately to warfarin are usually managed with off-label twice-daily enoxaparin injections as monotherapy. The approved duration of treatment of DVT and PE with fondaparinux is 5 to 9 days as a bridge to warfarin. Until now, no studies have investigated the use of fondaparinux for more than 26 days for the treatment of PE and more than 10 days for the treatment of DVT.
 Treatment doses of twice-daily enoxaparin are only Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for 5 to 14 days for bridging for the treatment of acute DVT and/or PE patients to warfarin.
 Fondaparinux is a synthetic antithrombotic agent with specific anti-factor Xa activity. Its pharmacokinetic properties allow for a simple, fixed-dose, once daily regimen of subcutaneous injection, without the need for dose adjustment based on laboratory monitoring.
 Fondaparinux is available only in 3 treatment doses and is prescribed once every 24 hours based on patient's weight: 5 mg for patients weighing less than 50 kg, 7.5 mg for patients weighing between 50 to 100 kg, and 10 mg for patients weighing more than 100 kg and is available in prefilled syringes. Also, fondaparinux does not cross react with heparin-induced platelet antibodies, and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia has never been documented with fondaparinux.
 The MATISSE Investigators showed that once-daily, subcutaneous administration of fondaparinux for at least 5 days and until 2 consecutive INRs were greater than 2.0 as a bridge to warfarin is at least as effective and safe as adjusted-dose, intravenous administration of unfractionated heparin as a bridge to warfarin in the initial treatment of hemodynamically stable patients with pulmonary embolism. During the 3-month follow up, 42 of the 1103 patients randomly assigned to receive fondaparinux (3.8 percent) had recurrent thromboembolic events, as compared with 56 of the 1110 patients randomly assigned to receive unfractionated heparin (5.0 percent). Major bleeding occurred in 1.3 percent of the patients treated with fondaparinux and 1.1 percent of those treated with unfractionated heparin. Mortality rates at three months were similar in the two groups.
 In another randomized double-blinded trial by the MATISSE Investigators, patients were randomized to fondaparinux once daily versus enoxaparin twice daily for at least 5 days and until 2 consecutive INRs were greater than 2.0 as a bridge to warfarin for initial treatment of acute symptomatic DVT. Fondaparinux was found to be as effective and safe as twice-daily enoxaparin during the 3-month follow up period. 43 (3.9%) of 1098 patients randomly assigned to fondaparinux had recurrent thromboembolic events compared with 45 (4.1%) of 1107 patients randomly assigned to enoxaparin. Major bleeding occurred in 1.1% of patients receiving fondaparinux and 1.2% of patients receiving enoxaparin. Mortality rates were 3.8% and 3.0%, respectively.
 These two MATISSE trial totaled 4418 patients and led to the FDA approval of fondaparinux in the treatment of acute symptomatic DVT and PE as a bridge to warfarin.
 In this investigator-initiated trial, we will conduct a cohort study with once daily fondaparinux as monotherapy without warfarin for 90-day management of DVT and/or PE in patients who are unable to tolerate or respond adequately to warfarin.
 Research Design and Methods:
 This is a cohort study with a sample size of 30 patients at Brigham and Women's Hospital with history of DVT and/or PE who are intolerant to warfarin or not responding to warfarin.
 During the study there will be 3 visits at day zero, week 6, and at day 90. Patients will be monitored closely for any bleeding complications.
 During these visits, blood will be drawn for platelet counts, renal function, hematocrit, and transaminase level.
 Primary endpoints 1. Recurrent acute symptomatic DVT confirmed by venous ultrasound and/or CT scan 2. Recurrent acute symptomatic PE confirmed by chest CT scan 3. Major hemorrhage defined as spinal, retroperitoneal or intracranial bleeding, drop in hemoglobin ≥2g/dl or transfusion ≥2U or surgical or medical intervention, death related to bleeding
 Secondary endpoints

 Randomised,Blinded,Efficacy study
 Further study details as provided by DBCG ( Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group):
 Primary outcome measures:
 Diagnostic outcome of a yearly screening with MR versus combined mammography and ultrasound of the breast measured by accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values.
 Secondary outcome measures:
 Comparison of diagnostic outcome of MR versus combined mammography and ultrasound, in women with dense breast tissue compared with women with fatty breast tissue.
 Comparison of the cancers found in women with BRCA gene mutations compared with the cancers found in the background population in respect of morphology, size, histological type, axillary lymph node status and grade.
 Study start : January 2007. Expected completion 2010.
 Women with BRCA gene mutations are more likely than others to develop the disease at a young age when breast density is higher than at older age.The tumours often are more rapidly developing with a short presymptomatic phase. These factors are known to reduce the effectiveness of screening with mammography and mammography seems to have a low sensitivity in women with BRCA gene mutations. Other studies have shown that more than 50% of the cancers appears as interval cancers between two mammography screening examinations and many have positive axillary nodes at the time of diagnosis.
 Around 610 women are tested BRCA gene positive in Denmark in year 2006. These women are offered a yearly screening with mammography combined with ultrasound and a clinical examination. The trial will test whether this screening offer should be combined with or replaced by MR mammography."

 Introduction :
 Postoperative pain is not only a consequence of the surgical lesion, but is also related to sensitization processes that appear in peripheral and central nerves. This sensitization induce clinically hyperalgesia and allodynia. From an experimental viewpoint it comes mainly from a central activation of NMDA receptors in neurons that conduct the nociceptive message.
 Recent studies have shown that high-dose opioids were able, via NMDA receptors, to enhance postoperative hyperalgesia and to increase pain scores and morphine consumption after surgery. Nevertheless per operative use of opioid is still necessary to avoid per operative stress and systemic consequence of the surgical stimulation.
 Some drugs (ketamine, nitrous oxide…) succeeded in reducing postoperative hyperalgesia and pains scores and acute morphine tolerance. They also were able to decrease pain chronicization.
 Nefopam, well known as an analgesic since the 80's, presents both analgesic and anti hyperalgesic properties as lately demonstrated in experimental trials. Nevertheless these anti hyperalgesic properties have never been evaluated in humans scheduled for cardiac surgery. Nefopam administration could reduce acute morphine tolerance and could enhance postoperative pain management by reducing sensitization processes and hyperalgesia.
 Objective :
 The main purpose of this clinical trial will be to evaluate in patients scheduled for cardiac surgery with sternotomy the nefopam effects on the nociceptive threshold evaluated with dynamic Von Frey mechanical stimulation.
 The secondary objectives will evaluate static hyperalgesia, postoperative pain scores, morphine consumption, cognitive functions, and development of chronic pain and dysesthesia.
 Methods :
 Prospective, randomized, double-blind study that will compare three parallel groups that will receive the same per operative anesthesia except for the nefopam doses.
 Group 1: nefopam infusion will start before the surgical incision, at the induction time of anesthesia and will be continued until postoperative H48. Group 2: nefopam administration will start at the end of the surgery and will be continued until postoperative H48. Group 3: control group that will receive a placebo from the induction time of anesthesia until H48.
 All patients will receive postoperatively morphine infusion following the Patient Controlled
 Analgesia concept.
 Number of patients to be included : 90 Duration of the study : 2 years Start : second semester of 2006
 Expected result :
 Reduction of the extend of hyperalgesia around the wound evaluated with dynamic Von Frey mechanical stimulation more than 20%."

 Tuberculosis (TB) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in organ transplant recipients. Although the tuberculin skin test (TST) is recommended for screening of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) in all candidates for liver transplantation, the performance of the TST in this setting is less than optimal, due to a lack of specificity and a lack of sensitivity in a population that is relatively immunocompromised. Recently, a new test named
 QuantiFERON-TB Gold (QFT-G) has been approved for the diagnosis of LTBI. QFT-G is expected to be more specific than TST. However, there are no studies defining the performance of QFT-G in a population of patients on a waiting list for liver transplantation. We plan to estimate the usefulness of the QFT-G test for the diagnosis of LTBI in a cohort of patients with end-stage liver disease. We hypothesize that the QFT-G test will correlate better with the risk of
 LTBI."

 Recruitment:
 The patients with ADPKD are recruited from the Outpatient Nephrology Clinic of the Department of Medicine, Holstebro Hospital (Holstebro, Denmark). The control subjects are recruited by advertising in public institutions and private companies.
 Number of Subjects:
 A difference in u-AQP2CR of 40 ng/mmol is considered the minimal relevant difference. A sample size of 10 subjects, who can be evaluated, has 80% power to detect this difference assuming a level of signiﬁcance of 5% and an SD of 30 ng/mmol. Because a few subjects are expected to drop out, 14-15 subjects will be included in each group.
 Experimental Procedure Before the Study Day:
 Five days before the study day, the subjects collect a standardized, HS (300 mmol sodium/day/17.5 g salt/day) or LS (30 mmol sodium/day/1.8 g salt/day), 4-day diet from the hospital kitchen. Depending on the individually estimated energy requirement, the participants are given either a diet of 8,000 or 11,000 kJ/day. The energy distribution is 55% carbohydrates, 15% proteins, and 30% lipids. The 4-day diet is started the following morning. The ﬂuid intake is also standardized during the 4 days. The subjects are asked to drink exactly 250 ml/1,000 kJ/day and to abstain from coffee, tea, and alcoholic beverages.
 The subjects are instructed to keep their physical activity unchanged during the two experiments and to abstain from hard training. The subjects have to collect their urine for 24 h the day before the study day.
 Experimental Procedure on the Study Day:
 On the study day, the subjects are asked to drink 175 ml of water every 30 min from 7:00 AM.
 The subjects arrive at the department at 8:00 AM. Peripheral iv lines are inserted into the antecubital veins of both forearms, one for infusion of 51Cr-EDTA and hypertonic saline, and one for withdrawal of blood samples. The subjects will be kept in the supine position from 8:00 AM to 1:30 PM except during voiding, which will take place in the sitting or standing position. At 8:30 AM, a priming dose of 51Cr-EDTA is administered, followed by sustained infusion. After 60 min of equilibration, the study will continue with ﬁve clearance periods, the ﬁrst two of 30-min duration (P1-P2), the last three of 60-min duration (P3-P5). The ﬁrst two clearance periods are baseline periods. At 10:30 AM, 7 ml/kg of 3% saline is given over 30 min. Blood pressure and heart rate are measured every 30 min from 9:30 AM to 1:30 PM.
 Urine is collected in each clearance period and analyzed for sodium, osmolality, u-AQP2, u-ENaC-betaCR, u-cAMP, u-PGE2, and 51CrEDTA. Blood samples will be drawn every 30 min from 9:30 AM to 10:30 AM and every hour from 11:30 AM to 1:30 PM, and will be analyzed for sodium, osmolality, and 51Cr-EDTA. In addition, analysis of p-AVP, p-Renin, p-ANG II, p-Aldo, p-ANP, and p-BNP will be performed from blood samples drawn at 10:30 AM, 11:30 AM, 12:30 PM, and 1:30 PM.
 Statistics:
 Statistical analyses will be performed using SPSS version 15 (SPSS, Chicago, IL). Single baseline values are obtained by taking the weighted average of the measurements from the two baseline periods. The baseline values of the two groups will be compared by Student's t-test.
 The baseline values during HS and LS intake will be compared by paired samples t-tests. The investigators will use the General Linear Model Repeated Measures procedure in SPSS with time as the within-subject factor and group as the between-subject factor to compare the effect variables in patients and controls. The changes in response to the hypertonic saline infusion in each group will be analyzed with the General Linear Model Repeated Measures procedure with time as the within-subject factor and paired samples t-tests with Bonferroni correction as post hoc tests. P values Recruitment The patients with ADPKD will be recruited from the Outpatient Nephrology Clinic of the Department of Medicine, Holstebro Hospital (Holstebro, Denmark). The control subjects will be recruited by advertising in public institutions and private companies.
 Number of Subjects A difference in u-AQP2CR of 40 ng/mmol is considered the minimal relevant difference. A sample size of 10 subjects, who could be evaluated, has 80% power to detect this difference assuming a level of signiﬁcance of 5% and an SD of 30 ng/mmol. Because a few subjects are expected to drop out, 14-15 subjects will be included in each group.
 Experimental Procedure Before the Study Day Five days before the study day, the subjects will collect a standardized, HS (300 mmol sodium/day/17.5 g salt/day) or LS (30 mmol sodium/day/1.8 g salt/day), 4-day diet from the hospital kitchen. Depending on the individually estimated energy requirement, the participants will be given either a diet of 8,000 or 11,000 kJ/day. The energy distribution will be 55% carbohydrates, 15% proteins, and 30% lipids. The 4-day diet will start the following morning. The ﬂuid intake is also standardized during the 4 days. The subjects are asked to drink exactly 250 ml/1,000 kJ/day and to abstain from coffee, tea, and alcoholic beverages. The subjects will be instructed to keep their physical activity unchanged during the two experiments and to abstain from hard training. The subjects have to collect their urine for 24 h the day before the study day.
 Experimental Procedure on the Study Day On the study day, the subjects are asked to drink 175 ml of water every 30 min from 7:00 AM. The subjects arrive at the department at 8:00 AM.
 Peripheral iv lines will be inserted into the antecubital veins of both forearms, one for infusion of 51Cr-EDTA and hypertonic saline, and one for withdrawal of blood samples. The subjects will be kept in the supine position from 8:00 AM to 1:30 PM except during voiding, which will take place in the sitting or standing position. At 8:30 AM, a priming dose of 51Cr-EDTA is administered, followed by sustained infusion. After 60 min of equilibration, the study will continue with ﬁve clearance periods, the ﬁrst two of 30-min duration (P1-P2), the last three of 60-min duration (P3-P5). The ﬁrst two clearance periods are baseline periods.
 At 10:30 AM, 7 ml/kg of 3% saline is given over 30 min. Blood pressure and heart rate will be measured every 30 min from 9:30 AM to 1:30 PM. Urine is collected in each clearance period and analyzed for sodium, osmolality, u-AQP2, u-ENaC-betaCR, u-cAMP, u-PGE2, and 51CrEDTA.
 Blood samples will be drawn every 30 min from 9:30 AM to 10:30 AM and every hour from 11:30
 AM to 1:30 PM, and will be analyzed for sodium, osmolality, and 51Cr-EDTA. In addition, analysis of p-AVP, p-Renin, p-ANG II, p-Aldo, p-ANP, and p-BNP will be performed from blood samples drawn at 10:30 AM, 11:30 AM, 12:30 PM, and 1:30 PM.
 Statistics Statistical analyses will be performed using SPSS version 15 (SPSS, Chicago, IL).

 The recently completed trial by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD)-sponsored Maternal-Fetal Medicine Units (MFMU) Network has demonstrated that intramuscular 17-alpha-hydroxyprogesterone caproate (17-OHPC) substantially reduces the rate of preterm birth in women at high risk for preterm delivery because of a prior spontaneous preterm birth. No other strategy or treatment for prevention of preterm birth has proven to be effective. Consequently, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has cautiously supported this treatment but points out that much more information about this therapy and alternative therapies is required. Although a large body of evidence exists about the safety of this treatment, almost nothing is known about the pharmacology of this agent, especially in pregnancy. The purpose of this study is to define the pharmacology of 17-hydroxyprogesterone caproate in pregnancy. This protocol will focus on pharmacokinetics and placental transport and provide preliminary data on the pharmacoepidemiology of 17-OHPC.
 The primary research question of this study is: Do the pharmacokinetics of 17-OHPC as represented by area under the concentration vs. time curve after IM injection of 250 mg 17-OHPC differ between the second and third trimesters of pregnancy? We will obtain blood samples prior to and daily for one week after injection of 17-OHPC (8 samples total) for each of two parts of the study, with an optional third part for eligible subjects. Additionally, blood samples will be collected prior to each weekly injection of the study drug and at time of delivery. Approximately 60 subjects (ages 18-45) will be accrued at one of the Obstetrical
 Fetal Pharmacology Research Units (OPRU) Network sites, with 15 at Magee-Womens Hospital of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. Study treatment will be administered until delivery. The total duration of this multi-center study is 2-3 years."

 The purpose of this study is to obtain preliminary data on the safety and acceptability of
 UC-781 vaginal microbicide gel (0.1% and 0.25%) versus placebo when rectally administered in
 HIV-1 seronegative adults.
 Participants will enter a screening period, which includes Visit 1 and if necessary a medication washout period.
 Subjects who are deemed eligible after this screening period will return for a baseline evaluation (Visit 2), including clinical evaluation and mucosal specimen collection, as well as the Baseline Behavioral Questionnaire (BBQ). The BBQ will be administered by Computer
 Assisted Self-Interview (CASI). Subjects may complete the web-based CASI in the privacy of their own home. If a subject does not have access to the Internet, prefers to complete the
 BBQ at the study site, or requires assistance in using the CASI, he or she will be accommodated at the study site.
 After completing Visits 1 and 2, eligible subjects will be randomized to one of three groups: 0.1% UC-781 gel, 0.25% UC-781 gel, or a placebo gel (12 per group). A subset of 9 subjects (3 from each group) will also participate in a pK sub-study, which will include 6 timepoints (Visit 3- pre, 0.25 hr, 2 hr, 4 hr, Visit 3A- 24 hr, and Visit 5- 1 day post-QD dose). During randomization, study staff will be notified if the participant is randomized to the pK substudy.
 This study will involve 2 stages of treatment. Each treatment stage is independent of the other. This study aims to examine the effects of 2 different dosing regimens, NOT cumulative safety over the both stages.
 Once randomized, subjects will return to the clinic (Visit 3), where a single dose of the study gel (Treatment Stage 1) will be administered followed by clinical evaluation, including flexible sigmoidoscopy, and sample collection.
 Subjects will return to the clinic for Treatment Stage 2 Clearance (Visit 4), in the week prior to beginning Treatment Stage 2. If given clearance, the subject may begin Treatment
 Stage 2.
 In Treatment Stage 2, subjects will begin to self-administer once daily outpatient doses of the study gel for 7 days. After completion of Stage 2 the subject will complete a Product
 Acceptability Questionnaire (PAQ) by CASI and return to clinic for evaluation and specimen collection (Visit 5).
 After completion of Visit 5, subjects will be contacted by an interviewer to complete an in-depth phone interview regarding product acceptability."

 Background and rationale
 Many comments have been issued about similarities and differences between 2003 American and
 European guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension (1,2), especially after the publication of the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack
 Trial (ALLHAT) study (3-5). Both guidelines agree that the majority of hypertensive patients require more than one medication to achieve optimal blood pressure control and, consistent with the most recent findings, the need of expensive, large clinical trials to demonstrate the superiority of one medication on another is probably over (3,6). What is clear now is that blood pressure must be optimally controlled to reduce risk of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in population, no matter which combination of medications is used. Comparison between single medications is substantially academic and conceals the reality: in all trials, in most circumstances comparison is between combinations, more than single medications. In the Losartan Intervention for Endpoint Reduction Study (LIFE study) (6), for instance, there has been a comparison between the combination of losartan with low dose hydrochlorothiazide versus the combination of atenolol with the same diuretic.
 The difference between the seventh Joint National Committee (USA) on Prevention, Diagnosis and Management of Hypertension (JNC VII) and European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and
 European Society of Hypertension (ESH) 2003 guidelines, often presented as substantial, is in the priority that Americans still give to the diuretic therapy, consistent with the most waited results of the ALLHAT (3).
 The ALLHAT was a randomized, double-blind, multicenter clinical institutional trial, entirely sponsored by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) (3), and designed to determine whether occurrence of fatal or nonfatal coronary heart disease is lower for high risk hypertensive patients treated with amlodipine, lisinopril, doxazosin, or chlorthalidone.
 The protocol was also approved by an independent Review Committee external to the NHLBI (7).
 The ALLHAT recruited 9,000-15,000 participants/intervention arm (total: 33,357), and the follow-up was quite long (4-8 years). The doxazosin arm was closed prematurely because of higher mortality (8). Despite a number of important limitations of this study (4,9), the overall impact of its findings remains very high.
 The baseline characteristics of the ALLHAT participants were substantially similar in the 3 arms completing the study. Chlortalidone was significantly more effective than both amlodipine and lisinopril in achieving optimal control of blood pressure at year 1 and year 2 and more effective than lisinopril in blood pressure control at year 3, 4 and 5 (all p<0.001). Consistent with the better control of blood pressure, chlortalidone tended to provide a 10% more protection for combined fatal and non fatal coronary heart disease than lisinopril whereas protection was similar for amlodipine, though this protection was less evident than the superiority in controlling blood pressure. In fact, the difference in risk profile versus the lisinopril arm achieved statistical significance only for elderly and
 African-American participants.
 Another relevant finding from the ALLHAT concerns the incidence of congestive heart failure that was substantially less with chlortalidone than with either amlodipine or lisinopril.
 There are many recurrent criticisms to all trials showing the superiority of diuretics over other medications in controlling blood pressure. First of all, worsening of glucose metabolism, due to thiazide effects, is matter of concern (4,14-18). Also the ALLHAT authors report a higher incidence of diabetes in the diuretic group which, however, did not affect the outcome results (3). However, this concern is also sustained by recent evidence of the dangerous effect of incident diabetes in patients with arterial hypertension (15).
 One factor that might aggravate glucose metabolism during therapy with diuretics is the underestimated effect of hypokalemia, which interferes with glucose-stimulated insulin release, a condition that might be aggravated by association with beta-adrenergic block (19,20). Among other beneficial effects, including improvement in blood pressure control, correction of hypokalemia prevents or significantly reduces thiazide-induced hyperglycemia (21-24). It is possible that low-dose potassium-sparing diuretics by preventing hypokaleemia might also prevent metabolic effects of thiazide, at the same time enhancing the antihypertensive effects of thiazide (25), but, this hypothesis has never been tested in ad hoc trials.
 The second concern about the use of diuretics is the risk of low therapeutic compliance of hypertensive patients, due to the diuretic effect and other hypokalemia-related side-effects (26,27). These few reports, however, contrast with the evidence that quality of life is improved by long term therapy with diuretics (28-30). The effort, therefore, should probably be direct toward persistence of initial treatment with diuretics, a goal that might be reached by improving the procedures of follow-up, for instance, as we have recently proposed, by implementing internet-based digital networks, connecting hypertension specialists with general practitioners (31). The Campania Salute (CS)network is a system that was set up in 1995 by us (31). It is an italian regional network system aimed at improving the management of essential hypertension by integrating the activity of general practitioners (GPs) with hypertension specialists. This network includes about 12.000 hypertensive patients followed by 23 outpatient hypertensive clinics allocated in different Community Hospitals in the
 Campania Region and 60 GPs, homogeneously allocated in the regional area, referring to the
 Hypertension Clinic of Federico II University Hospital in Naples (coordinating centre). GPs were randomly selected among a pool of physicians referring their patients to the
 Hypertension Clinic at Federico II University. Through the CS system clinical data detected at each visit can be shared between the coordinating center and the peripheral units.Low-risk hypertensive patients continue their follow up in the peripheral units, whereas high-risk hypertensive patients are more closely followed up by the coordinating centre, which also evaluates target organ damage and associated diseases. Patients' information is shared through on-line access to the remote database, integrated by smartcards. The smartcard belongs to patients and contains his/her personal identification number (PIN). This PIN allows users to access the file of the patient stored in the database. Each physician has also his own PIN to access into the database, limited to his/her own patient files. Clinical data are upgraded at each visit by GPs and physicians of both peripheral centres and coordinator centre. Access to the remote database allows users to read all clinical and laboratory data, as well as tracking electrocardiography (ECG) and cardiac and vascular ultrasound images. In addition, the smartcard also works as portable database in which identification and clinical data are reported. By virtue of a central database, data of individual patients can be stored, updated and retrieved directly on-line by participants in the project. The restricted access to individual data requires the pre-assigned identification code of both the patient and the relevant remote units. The central database uses Wincare software (TSD Projects, Milan, Italy) which contains separate sheets for medical history, physical examination, biochemistry electrocardiography, cardiovascular ultrasound, other imaging tests and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. The last update of an individual patient's record can also be downloaded and stored in the patient's personal smartcard. We started the CS project with the aim of obtaining a stronger interaction between
 GPs and hypertension clinics, by providing a direct link and accessible patients' records.
 Blood pressure control was improved with our referral system, since better overall results were obtained if the patient was followed within the network. Indeed, at the end of the observation period, 51% of patients in the CS group had a blood pressure below 140/90 mmHg, a percentage comparable to that of patients included in clinical trials.
 This follow-up strategy also allowed an active pharmacovigilance procedure, with side effects promptly reported to the GPs, which prevented the occurrence of difference in compliance among the various antihypertensive treatments. In addition, this kind of follow-up allowed by means of pharmacogenetic studies to demonstrate that the occurrence of side effects may be predicted from individual genotype (32). Indeed, we have recently reported that in patients bearing β2AR gene Glu27 variant or the β3AR gene Arg64 variant there was a larger occurrence of hypertriglyceridemia, alone or in combination with elevated cholesterol levels.
 Furthermore, the β2AR Glu27variant significantly associates with hypetriglyceridemia in a cumulative fashion. The risk of developing this side effect after β-blockade was four-fold higher in patients homozygous for the β2AR Glu27 variant than in β2AR27Gln allele. This result not only allowed the identification of patients at high risk to develop metabolic complications to chronic β-blockade treatment, but also contributed to elucidate the pathophysiological mechanisms which mediate these side effects, raising the possibility to prevent them.
 Objectives of the study
 This study has been designed to assess whether a follow-up strategy based on a strict cooperation between GPs and hypertension specialists allows the use of diuretics as first-line antihypertensive treatment with a persistence on assigned therapy equivalent to that achieved by using any other first line antihypertensive therapy. Assessment of safety and efficacy for controlling cardiovascular risk will be also performed as secondary endpoint. In fact, in contrast with trials comparing single-drug effects, this study compares two strategies of antihypertensive management, based on either real-word prescriptions or a regimen in which thiazide diuretics represent a forced first line antihypertensive therapy.
 If our hypothesis will be demonstrated diuretics might be suggested as an efficient and economic first line antihypertensive treatment, on which build up optimal antihypertensive therapy by adding other class drugs, in all patients, provided that the follow-up procedure is based on the proposed organization. This approach will be of great utility for the
 National Health Care System to reduce costs, since, a large part of the economic burden is related to the use of antihypertensive medications more expensive than thiazides, as first line agents, in particular so far only 40% of the hypertensive patients receive diuretics in their therapy.
 Finally, the pharmacogenetic study is focused on characterization of polymorphisms of candidate genes associated to development of metabolic side effects of diuretics, to help understanding of mechanisms underlying these adverse events. This kind of information will help to prevent the occurrence of adverse events by the use of adeguate combination treatment, thus resulting in the further reduction of the cost of antihypertensive treatment due to the reduction of the number of patients that discontinue therapy for occurrence of adverse events.
 Study design
 This is a multicenter, open label, randomized study to compare the effects of an antihypertensive strategy using a thiazide diuretic as first-line, versus the use as initial therapy of other antihypertensive treatments. All the analyses will be performed by personel blinded to treatment. The study will be performed in collaboration with the Società Italiana
 Medicina Generale (SIMG), Sezione Campania, and the Società Italiana Ipertensione Arteriosa (SIIA), Sezione Campania.
 Study population. The recruitment phase will last 8 months. During this period 2600 patients will be enrolled, in the offices of 260 GPs' with documented previous experience in controlled studies, performed according to recommendations of Good Clinical Practice, and availability to access to Internet. Selected GPs will be trained to the use of the web-based database on which they will store the required information of patients participating into the study. This training period will last a week and will be supervised by the coordinator's center. Exemplificative print outs of the web-based CRF are available for evaluation on the web site www.campaniasalute.it.
 GPs are required: 1) to record a full medical history, including smoking and drinking habits, based on a pre-defined clinical record; 2) to collect demographic and anthropometric measures (height, weight, waist circumference at the iliac crest); 3) to perform a complete physical exam. At baseline and at each visit thereafter, seated office blood pressure will be measured in triplicate using a manual sphygmomanometer according to international guidelines.
 Measurements will be rounded to the closest 2 mmHg interval.
 Inclusion criteria: Hypertensive patients will be 18 to 75-year old. Eligible patients are required to have stage Ic or II essential hypertension, and to be previously untreated or poorly controlled. They will be selected by GPs participating into the study. Similar to untreated patients, those with poor control of blood pressure under multiple-drug therapy will start treatment with one single drug, which will be titrated to the highest dose before adding subsequent medications, based on the GP's judgement.
 Hypertension will be defined according to 2003 ESH/ESC guidelines (1). Blood and urine tests will be performed, according to guidelines for Hypertension Management For General
 Practitioners (GP) of the Regione Campania (see Bollettino Ufficiale Regione Campania, number 11, 18/02/2002, allegato A). This screening includes cell blood counts (CBCs), serum creatinine, sodium, potassium, uric acid, total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL-cholesterol, glucose, urine analysis and EKG. LDL will be calculated starting from the total cholesterol, triglyceride and HDL-cholesterol.
 Exclusion criteria. Women in fertile age not using recognized contraceptive methods, or pregnant or nursing will be excluded from the protocol, since the use of many antihypertensive drugs is contraindicated in pregnancy and lactation. Patients will be excluded when presenting with documented coronary or cerebrovascular events in the previous 6 months, NYHA class higher than 1, history of congestive heart failure, secondary hypertension, cancer disease, renal disease (serum creatinine >2 mg/dl), liver cirrhosis or severe dysfunction, or any other health problem that may interfere with the projected 2 year follow-up. Data will be stored in an electronic database located in the Coordinating Centre, to which GPs may have access for uploading data on a daily base, using personal, encrypted, login and password. Eligible patients will be asked for written informed consent and thereafter referred to the identified Hypertension Specialist Centre located in their areas, for end-organ damage evaluation by echocardiography, carotid ultrasound and urine dip-stick.
 These data will be stored in the central database. After local echocardiographic evaluation, patients showing left ventricular Ejection Fraction < 45% will be excluded from the study.
 Eligible patients will be asked for blood sampling for genomic DNA analysis and then randomised by the coordinating centre to either diuretics or other treatment. This latter will be decided by the GPs. Randomization will be organized in permuted blocks of 10 patients for each GP, half of which will be assigned to diuretics. The randomization code will be communicated to the referring GP by e-mail.
 Blood samples for genetic analysis and signed informed consents will be sent to the coordinating centre for storage. Blood samples will be coded and anonymously processed for genetic analysis by the Department of Pharmacology of FEDERICO II University of Naples. The data resulting from this analysis will be stored in the patient CRF page.
 Intervention: Drugs will be administered orally. GPs should use chlortalidone (12.5-25 mg daily) in the arm with compulsive thiazide diuretic as first line. In the alternative arm,
 GPs may choose any appropriate single-drug (excluding thiazide diuretic) or combination therapy, as first-line, at the tolerated dose.
 After randomization, patients will be evaluated monthly at the GPs' office, for therapy adjustment, to achieve blood pressure normalization (i.e Systolic Blood pressure >140 mmHg, and Diastolic Blood pressure >90 mmHg). In the thiazide arm, if blood pressure normalization is not achieved not even with the maximal dose, it will be possible to add any other classes of antihypertensive drugs. Once blood pressure normalization is achieved, GPs will monitor blood pressure once every 2 months, at the renewal of the drug prescription. Blood pressure values will be stored in the central database. At each visit, GPs will record drug therapy, including concomitant medications, evaluate the compliance to assigned antihypertensive regimen, and monitor and record adverse events by reporting all data in the CRF. After two years from randomization, patients will be checked for blood and urine tests and referred to the Hypertension Specialist Centre for echocardiography, carotid ultrasounds and urine dip-stick. This data will be stored in the central database.
 Information retrieval: At each visit, the GPs will record drug therapy, including concomitant medications, will evaluate the compliance to the assigned antihypertensive medications by pill count, and will monitor and record adverse events by reporting all data in the CRF.
 Pre clinical cardiovascular disease will be assessed by echocardiography and carotid ultrasonography. All ultrasound exams will be sent to the Reading Center at Federico II
 University Hospital and will be processed, according to procedures described in the annex.
 Monitoring of the study: All data will be reported on a specifically designed electronic clinical research form (CRF) (see web site: www.campaniasalute.com), and will be transferred to the Coordinating Center for data storage and analysis. The Steering Committee will appoint a Data Coordinating Committee to evaluate all CRFs on a continuous way to ensure quality and objectivity of the analysis performed by trained professionals. In order to monitor for patient security, GPs will be asked to actively monitor periodically for adverse events, by asking patients at the time of drug prescription renewal for the occurrence of symptoms or signs that can be related to aggravation of their condition or adverse events of therapy. In selected cases, GPs can refer the patients to the Hypertension Specialist Centre for eventual instrumental and or blood and urinary analyses. Adverse events will be reported in the digital CRF.
 Sample size estimate: The main outcome to be tested is whether persitance on therapy of an antihypertensive regimen based on diuretics as first choice is equivalent to that obtained in a free regimen using any other antihypertensive medication as first choice (equivalence study).
 As secondary outcomes, reduction of left ventricle (LV) mass and carotid intima-media thickness will be evaluated as markers of preclinical cardiovascular disease, under the hypothesis that improvement of end-organ damage under diuretic-based treatment will not be different from the treatment based on other antihypertensive medications (equivalence). The reduction of the ESH/ESC risk-score will also be evaluated, under the same equivalence hypothesis. Sample size was primarily estimated for the primary outcome, but afterward tested on power also on secondary outcomes. See Annex for details
 Organizational characteristics: The study will be governed by a Steering Committee chaired by the Principal Investigator (Prof. Bruno Trimarco). The study will be performed as a collaborative effort of 260 general practitioners (with previous experience in scientific initiatives), specialist centers (Community Hospitals and University Hospitals in which specialized evaluation of hypertension related organ damage is routinely evaluated). The
 Department of Medicina Clinica, Scienze Cardiovascolari ed Immunologiche, division of
 Coronary Intensive Care Unit and High Blood Pressure Center will act as a Coordinating
 Center, run by Professor Trimarco, PI. The central database will be stored at this center, and the other specialist centers and GPs will have remote access to it through encrypted login and password. The web-based access to the database has already been implemented at the
 Coordinating Center, within the Campania Salute Project, a regional network of Community
 Hospitals and GPs.
 Echocardiograms and carotid ultrasounds will be performed at the Federico II University
 Hospital or in peripheral centers, under a standardized protocol, which will be distributed in an electronic format (CD-ROM). All studies will be directly transmitted through the
 Internet to the Reading Center.
 Feasibility: The Principal Investigator, Bruno Trimarco, has a long and extensive experience in running trials of antihypertensive treatment and management of hypertension (see CV). As
 Director of the Coordinating Institution he will personally assure full support of the institution facilities, and of professional help in monitoring and statistics.
 The Ultrasound Reading Center has wide experience in centralized reading of studies on LV hypertrophy and function as well as in studies on arterial structure and has been involved in a number of international multicenter trials (35,40). The Reading Center is provided of 4 work stations for echocardiographic reading and 2 for carotid ultrasound, with high level of security for preservation of data and privacy. All echocardiograms will be classified with a reception number which will join the recruitment number of the participant (every participants will have 2 identification numbers in addition to the number of identification document).
 Timing: The study will last 3 years. The first eigth months will be spent for recruitment and randomization. The follow-up will last 2 years. Analysis of data will be performed ad interim, as soon as the last recruited patient completes the intermediate evaluation after one year of follow-up. Final main analysis will be performed right after the conclusion of follow-up of the last recruited patient. A number of analysis concerning secondary end-points and including every ancillary study that might be proposed from the Steering Committee or the participating Hypertension Specialist Centres, will be implemented thereafter.
 Ethical aspects. We have tried to minimize possible therapy related side effects to those that are usually observed in the practical clinic. Indeed, all treatments and dosages are those that are usually adopted by general practitioner for the daily practice. Therefore, we do not expect any additional risk for patients that are enrolled in the study. The complications that are associated to thiazide treatment will be prevented by the use of maximal doses that are in the low range of therapeutic effect, and close to the regimen that currently used in daily practice. As for intromission in the private sphere of the patients, the data will be nominally entered in the database by the physician using a login/password protected web-based 32bit encrypted connection, and available only for this research purposes after given informed consent by the patients."

 Sickle cell disease is a genetic disorder in which a mutation in the beta chain of human hemoglobin results in abnormal blood hemoglobin, causing red blood cells to sickle under stress with resulting symptoms including severe pains and strokes. Beta thalassemia is another genetic disorder in which there are abnormal beta hemoglobin chains, causing anemia.
 In both disorders, frequent red blood cell transfusions may be required to sustain life, but these often result in complications including multiple hospitalizations, iron overload, or bacterial or viral infections such as hepatitis. Standard drugs and therapies used in the treatment of sickle cell disease and/or beta thalassemia provide only supportive care, and may result in long-term side effects, and inadequate control of the disease process. Bone marrow transplant has been increasingly used for the long-term treatment and cure of sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia. Although, not without acute and potential long term side effects, this alternative offers long term control and potential cure of the disease. Most of the side effects seen with bone marrow transplant are directly related to the high intensity of chemotherapy used (ablative)."

 Childhood obesity is rapidly reaching epidemic proportions in the United Kingdom. Recent studies have indicated a prevalence level for obesity of 15% at 15 years of age. The implications for metabolic, cardiovascular and cancer risk in later life are enormous. The
 International Obesity Task Force (IOTF) and the European Association for the Study of Obesity (EASO) have identified childhood obesity as a matter for urgent attention. However, there are very few obesity clinics for children in the UK and effective treatment regimens are simply not available. We have developed an obesity clinic at the Royal Hospital for Children in
 Bristol and observed effective weight reduction in pre-pubertal children. Our simple treatment framework has proved far less effective in adolescence. We have therefore collaborated with an eating disorder clinic from the Karolinska Institute in Sweden to develop a novel therapy to treat obesity using modified equipment originally designed to treat adolescents with DSM-IV eating disorders. Pilot data indicate that adolescents are better able to address the issue of weight reduction within this treatment modality. Having established the software and treatment process we now wish to perform a randomised, control trial to test the efficacy of this new treatment against that currently provided."

 Histological inflammation in patients with Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) appears to predict clinical progression and ultimate long-term response to various medical therapies, including finasteride. Discovery of a urine or serum marker of prostate inflammation will be an invaluable clinical tool to predict a man's risk of BPH progression and the efficacy of various medical therapies to reduce that risk.
 Specific Aim:
 We plan to determine if urokinase plasminogen activators (and/or other inflammatory markers) in serum, urine and tissue of patients can predict prostatic inflammation
 Background:
 Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) and Inflammation
 BPH is a common disorder of the prostate causing significant lower urinary tract symptoms and negatively affects the quality of life in a substantial proportion of men in North America.
 According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), BPH affects more than 50% of men over age 60 and as many as 90% of men over the age of 70. Although there are numerous genetic and epigenetic changes associated with the progression of normal prostatic glandular formation to
 BPH, as early as 1994 our group suggested that the presence of prostatic inflammation could be associated with pathogenesis and progression of both histological and clinical BPH. We have demonstrated that histological prostate inflammation is very common in patients with BPH as well as patients who are both symptomatic and not symptomatic. Our local research group spearheaded an international consensus classification system for prostatic inflammation that we have subsequently employed in our ongoing study of over 8,000 men undergoing 3 serial biopsies over a 4 year period of time. The MTOPS BPH study data base subanalyses of the more than 1,000 men who underwent baseline biopsies strongly suggested that prostatic inflammation appears to be the strongest and most robust predictor of symptomatic progression as well as response to drug therapy. An analyses T-cell phenotypes, cytokine expression patterns and cellular cross talk in BPH tissues of 101 BPH patients and prostatic cell cultures showed that chronic inflammation triggers histological and clinical progression. The search for urine or serum biomarkers of prostatic inflammation is highly relevant to better target therapies for men with this common condition.
 Urokinase Plasminogen Activator System
 Proteolytic enzymes are required to mediate inflammatory cell infiltration in tissues, a process highly regulated by the cell surface-specific receptor (uPAR) a binding partner for the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA). Numerous previous clinical investigations have indicated that serum levels of the plasminogen activation system are an effective marker of inflammation in several disease processes including CNS inflammation, asthma, metabolic syndrome and pre-eclampsia. Very little data is available regarding the plasma levels of soluble uPAR in benign prostatic diseases, although one previous report suggested higher average levels of soluble uPAR in patients with lower urinary tract symptoms. Theses authors reported a wide variation of uPAR in BPH patients with some having greatly elevated levels while others had undetectable levels. However, the author's did not have pathological confirmation of their findings and could not quantify the level of inflammation in the prostatic tissue. We hypothesize that the absolute or relative serum levels of the urokinase plasminogen activator system, including uPA, uPAR and PAI-1,2 (inhibitors of the uPAR/uPA complex), are associated with inflammation in prostatic tissue."

 In the last decade, significant progress has been made in improving the heart health of individuals in the United States. However, despite these advances, many racial and ethnic minority groups still have high rates of cardiovascular disease. Korean Americans, in particular, are more prone to developing high blood pressure than other Americans or individuals living in Korea. Possible reasons for this may include stress, diet, or lifestyle changes that occur as a result of immigration. Because many Korean Americans have low health literacy skills, it may be harder for them to understand medication dosing instructions, keep track of medical appointments, or comprehend written medical information. Korean Americans have traditionally been identified as a hard to reach group, and few programs have specifically targeted these individuals with regards to improving blood pressure control. The purpose of this study is to evaluate a health literacy-focused intervention that aims to improve blood pressure control among older Korean Americans. The results from this study may be helpful in developing future literacy-focused blood pressure programs targeted to minority groups in the United States.
 In this study, participants will be randomly assigned to either a literacy-focused high blood pressure intervention or a wait-list control group, which will initially involve usual care from a regular medical provider. Participants in the intervention group will attend a weekly 2-hour educational session for 6 weeks. Bilingual research nurses and other professionals will facilitate these sessions, and each participant will receive a Korean language workbook with examples of medical terminology, prescription and appointment slips, and blood pressure management strategies. For 12 months, participants will self-monitor their blood pressure and record these measurements through a telephone management system. Community health workers will conduct telephone counseling on a monthly basis and those participants with uncontrolled blood pressure will receive more intensive support and follow-up counseling. Study visits will occur at Week 6 and Months 6, 12, 18, and 24, at which time blood pressure, height, and weight will be measured. In addition, participants will complete questionnaires that assess health literacy, high blood pressure knowledge, problem solving and communication skills, treatment adherence, health care utilization, and quality of life. Participants in the control group will take part in the intervention once the study has been completed."

 Over 1 million patients receive mechanical ventilation every year in the United States. In mechanically ventilated patients, despite sedative infusions, sleep is severely disrupted.
 Sleep disruption, in turn, can lead to activation of sympathetic nervous system and elevated inflammatory cytokines. Both sympathetic hyperactivity and elevated cytokines have been associated with delirium, which, in turn, is associated with increased mortality and higher healthcare costs. Currently, however, there is very little understanding of the inter-relationship between critical illness, sleep, and neuropsychological well-being. The purpose of this study is to collect preliminary data on the short-term effects of sedation with and without sympatholysis on sleep and inflammation in critically ill patients receiving mechanical ventilation. This pilot study will be accomplished by performing sleep studies and circulating cytokine measurements in critically ill patients randomized to receive two different sedation strategies: Dexmedetomidine versus Midazolam and Fentanyl. The ultimate goal of this program of research is to identify sedation practices that are least associated with adverse short- and long-term consequences, and thereby ultimately help improve sleep quality and quality of life in patients surviving critical illness."

 Tuberculosis continues to be a major health problem in both the developing and developed countries because of its resurgence in the immunosuppressed patients. Short course chemotherapy containing isoniazid, rifampicin and pyrazinamide has proved to be highly effective in the treatment of tuberculosis. One of its adverse effect is liver damage which is the most common side effect leading to interruption of therapy.
 There is lack of consensus guidelines for treatment of anti-TB drug induced liver damage
 Whether the re-introduction should take place with all the drugs given together in full doses (which reduces the chance of resistance and cost to the patient) or in a phased manner. There is lack of studies which compared different regimens of re-introduction of anti-TB drugs.
 In this study, we will study three regimes of re-introduction of hepatotoxic anti-tuberculosis drugs (Rifampicin, Isoniazide, Pyrazinamide). These are potent anti-tuberculosis medications and need to be restarted in patients who developed liver toxicities attributed to these medications and became normal when these medicines were stopped. At the time of re-introduction the patients will be randomized in 3 groups.
 -  First group will receive Isoniazide(5mg/kg/day), Rifampicin(10mg/kg/day) and
 Pyrazinamide(25mg/kg/day) in full doses on day 1 and continued further.

 Background HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) are effective lipid-lowering agents and are known to reduce cardiovascular events. It was initially assumed that cholesterol reduction by statins was the only mechanism responsible for their beneficial effect. However, beneficial effects of statins seem to occur very early in the course of their therapy [1] and subgroup analysis of large trials indicates that subjects in statin-treated arms have less cardiovascular events than subjects in placebo-controlled arm with comparable serum cholesterol levels [2]. Therefore, it was suggested that statins may have antiatherogenic effects, such as anti-inflammatory and antioxidative actions, beyond their cholesterol lowering effect. Many studies have demonstrated a rapid improvement in vascular function with atorvastatine which cannot solely be accounted for by achieved lipid reduction [3-5]. In the
 Pravastatin or Atorvastatin evaluation and infection therapy-thrombolysis in myocardial infarction 22 trial (PROVE-IT-TIMI 22 trial), with a follow-up period of 2-years and intensive statin therapy, 80 mg atorvastatin showed a stronger reduction of cardiovascular events when compared with 40 mg pravastatin, with an apparent benefit observed early [6]. A rapid and a strong oxidative stress lowering effect of atorvastatin has been proposed as the probable mechanism of this action [7]. Other statins have been shown to have anti-oxidant effects as well [8,9]. However, whether atorvastatine has stronger antioxidant effect and whether atorvastatin lowers oxidative stress early in the course of therapy than other statins has not been demonstrated up to now.
 Hypothesis: Atorvastatin shows a more rapid and stronger antioxidative effect compared to simvastatin.
 Study objective The objective of this study is to compare the oxidative stress lowering capacity of atorvastatin, the most widely used statin in the US, with that of simvastatin in a population of patients with increased oxidative stress (in patients with diabetes mellitus
 [10], hypertension [11] obesity [12] and chronic kidney disease [13] who are known to have increased oxidative stress).
 Design and methods We plan to recruit sixty statin naive patients with diabetes mellitus type-2 and/or obesity (BMI > 25 kg/m2) and/or hypertension (RR> 140/90 mmHg). Patients with
 K/DOQI stage 5 chronic kidney disease (Cockcroft-Gault clearance of less than 15ml/min/1.73m2) and patients who use any vitamin preparation or statins in the last three months will be excluded from the study. Because of the documented influence of ACE-inhibitors on oxidative stress we will stratify patients for prior ACE-inhibitor use during randomization. All included patients are randomized to treatment with simvastatin 40 mg daily or atorvastatin 10 mg daily in order to achieve a comparable lipid reduction. Established parameters of oxidative stress, such as oxidized LDL, malondealdehyde will be measured (14-18) in plasma on inclusion, one week, six weeks and three months after the inclusion.
 Primary end point of the study will be the absolute difference between oxidized LDL reduction between the two groups. We also plan to measure endothelial function parameters such as soluble Vascular Adhesion Molecule (sVCAM) and von Willebrand factor. In addition parameters of inflammation such as high sensitive c-reactive protein, TNF-alfa and Interleuking-6 will also be measured to investigate whether there is any correlation between eventual oxidative stress lowering and endothelial function and inflammation. The inhibitory effect of HDL to prevent oxidation of LDL will be determined by measurement of lipid peroxides formed during in vitro oxidation of LDL co-incubated with HDL. The anti-inflammatory properties of HDL will be tested by measurement of the HDL capacity to inactivate oxidized palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine (ox-PAPC). For this measurement we will use a cell-free assay that has been developed by Navab and co-workers (19). Collections of 24 hours of urine at the beginning and after one week, and three months will be used to measure urine F2-isoprostane levels (20-24).
 Power calculation:
 The number of patients needed to detect an absolute Oxidized LDL difference of 9 U/L between the two groups over 3 months with a power of 80%, α of 0.05 and a SD of 12 was 30 patients per group."

 Engagement in non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI), purposefully harming oneself without the conscious intent to die such as cutting or burning, is pervasive among adolescents. Lifetime prevalence estimates among community samples of high school students range from 13.0% to 23.2%. Despite the significance of this public health problem, there are no known interventions that successfully reduce the frequency of NSSI or prevent NSSI in adolescents.
 The goal of the current study is to develop an effective psychosocial intervention for NSSI among adolescents who are engaging in self-injury and have a depressive disorder.
 Specifically, we will amend Interpersonal Psychotherapy for Depressed Adolescents (IPT-A), a psychotherapy that has demonstrated efficacy in treating depressed adolescents (Mufson et al., 1994, 1999, 2004), for use with adolescents with depression who are engaging in NSSI, with the ultimate goal of curing the depression and NSSI. Ten participants will be administered IPT-A and assessed several times throughout the course of the trial. It is expected that IPT-A will be a useful treatment for co-morbid depression and self-injury, although adaptations to the protocol will likely be needed to address the behavioral aspect of the self-injury. Data analyses will be descriptive in nature and involve examining the individual trajectories of depression and NSSI over time. The data obtained from the current study will lay the groundwork for an ultimate randomized controlled trial in which we plan to compare IPT-A versus nondirective supportive therapy in the treatment of co-morbid depression and NSSI."

 Schizophrenia is a serious mental disorder affecting individuals in multiple ways: behavior control, emotional and information processing and the functional levels conforming to societal norms. Despite recent advances in medication therapy in treating the target symptoms of schizophrenia , subsets of patients diagnosed with schizophrenia continue to exhibit negative symptoms ( social withdrawal,apathy, lack of drive )and cognitive impairment (memory, attention, judgment and reasoning). Recently, there has been interest to explore the efficacy of avenue of dietary and herbal supplements with known pharmacological actions in treatment and prevention of neuropsychiatric disorders, especially bipolar and schizophrenia.
 We hypothesize that Panax Ginseng , with multiple interactions with chemical pathways in the brain described as neurotransmitter systems (Dopamine, GABA and NMDA ) can improve the residual symptoms of schizophrenia when added to the antipsychotics currently used in the treatment of schizophrenia. Furthermore, in view of previous studies of Ginseng in enhancing memory , we hypothesize that the standardized formulation of Ginseng (Ginsana-115 from
 Boehringer Ingelheim-Pharmaton,Switzerland ) will optimize the antipsychotics in cognition impairment and negative symptoms. In the 18-week RCT cross-over study, schizophrenic subjects will be treated with either Ginsana-115 ( 100 mg or 200 mg by oral route) or placebo in a cross-over design. we plan to recruit 60 subjects diagnosed as schizophrenia from the four sites : London-St. Thomas, Ontario, Canada; Kingston Ontario Canada; Thunderbay, Ontario
 Canada and Middlesex, United Kingdom."

 Introduction: Bipolar disorder is an illness that consists of distinct episodes or poles of both major depression and mania (bipolar I) or major depression and hypomania (bipolar II).
 Both poles of the illness may be fully present simultaneously in what is referred to as a
 Mixed episode. The poles of Major depression, Mania and Mixed mood are currently defined by descriptive criteria in the psychiatric diagnostic manual, DSMIV.
 Estimates of the prevalence of Bipolar disorder are as high as 6% of the population.(1) It is a severe and potentially lethal illness which has a different course and treatment profile to unipolar depression, commonly known simply as major depression. In 50-60% of cases however, the initial presentation of bipolar disorder is one of major depression, and several episodes of depression may occur before declaration of bipolarity, by virtue of a manic or hypomanic episode (pre-bipolar depression).(2,3) The mainstay of treatment for unipolar major depression is antidepressants. In contrast, antidepressant monotherapy is contraindicated in
 Bipolar I depression and must be used very cautiously in Bipolar II illness (4) with much concern for an unacceptable cost /benefit ratio' because of the risk of antidepressant induction of mania and rapid cycling (increase in frequency of episodes as a consequence of antidepressants). (5). Hence treatment of the early depressive episodes of bipolar illness requires recognition of depression specific to bipolar disorder and appropriate choice of medication.
 Unfortunately, efforts to clearly distinguish bipolar from unipolar depression cross-sectionally have been mostly disappointing. Most evidence supports the value of family history(6) and there is variable predictive value for specific phenomenological and course descriptors such as hypersomnia, psychomotor retardation, early-onset and psychotic sub types(7,8).
 The dilemma then is two-fold: 1. Identifying patients suffering from major depression who are at high risk of bipolar disorder. 2. Choosing appropriate pharmacological treatment.
 In choosing pharmacological treatment for a high risk group, there is the possibility of causing harm with antidepressants if the true diagnosis is bipolar disorder, and of not treating the depression adequately if using mood stabilizers in what is truly a unipolar illness. This dilemma applies to a large subgroup of those presenting with depression. A recent study in a primary care setting suggested that as many as 21% of patients currently treated with antidepressants for a presumed depressive disorder may in fact have a bipolar diathesis, thus representing a large group that may be improperly treated(9).
 The concerns with the use of antidepressants in known bipolar depression have focused on antidepressant - induction of mania, and rapid cycling but these do not always present themselves immediately. However, there may be other subtle and immediate antidepressant treatment effects that make the diagnostic distinction possible and more pressing.(5,10)Indeed, it has been postulated that undetected bipolar depression may explain the apparent poor treatment response and increase in suicidality with the use of antidepressants in the adolescent population, where one might expect an increased prevalence of depression as first episode of bipolar disorder by virtue of earlier age of onset compared to unipolar illness.(11)
 Objectives:
 The objective of this proposal is to investigate response to acute lithium treatment in subjects who meet the diagnostic criteria for major depression, but are potentially at risk for bipolar disorder, by virtue of family history of bipolarity or completed suicide.
 Primary Hypothesis:
 Subjects with depression considered at risk for bipolar disorder, will show a significant clinical response to lithium.
 Secondary Hypothesis: 1. Subjects with depression considered at risk for bipolar disorder, will show a significant clinical response to paroxetine. 2. Treatment emergent mixed symptoms, in particular agitation, will occur only in the antidepressant treated group.
 Study Design:
 This is a 6 week double-blind randomized controlled pilot trial of lithium versus paroxetine in subjects with major depression who have either a family history of bipolar disorder or completed suicide. 20 subjects men or women above the age of 18 will be recruited at this centre.
 Patients will be randomized to receive either lithium or paroxetine at their first study visit and the dose of drug will be adjusted to find the right one for each patient. Patients will be assessed on a weekly basis thereafter.Data from this pilot study will help in the development of a larger adequately powered study to compare lithium and paroxetine in the treatment of depression in this high risk group.
 Patients excluded from the study would include subjects not able to give informed consent,pregnant or breast-feeding women,a current diagnosis of panic disorder, post traumatic stress disorder or psychosis,a history of mania or hypomania,active substance abuse or dependence in the last 6 months, a current depressive episode less than 4 weeks or greater than 12 months in duration, a current or prior adequate trial of lithium or paroxetine,concurrent use of other antidepressants or augmenting agents for the treatment of depression,or a clinically significant medical illness, in particular renal impairment."

 Although spousal support predicts the success of a smoker's cessation efforts, social support interventions based on teaching partners better support skills have had consistently disappointing results. In this Stage I (treatment development) study we examined the potential utility of a family-consultation (FAMCON) intervention based on family-systems theory.
 Specifically, in this Phase-I study we developed, standardized, and pilot tested a systemic, couple-focused treatment for change-resistant smokers based on the assumption that a smoker's marital and family relationships play a key role in whether he or she continues to smoke.
 The intervention provides up to 10 sessions of “family consultation” over 2-5 months to single- or dual-smoker couples in which at least one partner continued to smoke despite having lung disease, heart disease, or multiple cardiac risk factors.
 The treatment focuses on the immediate social context of smoking, aiming both to interrupt well-intended “solutions” that ironically feed back to keep smoking going, and to help clients realign important relationships in ways not organized around tobacco use.
 Participants were 20 couples in which one partner (the primary smoker) continued to smoke despite having or being at significant risk for heart or lung disease.
 Results are promising. The 50% rate of stable abstinence achieved by primary smokers over 6 months (with 63% abstinence rates for secondary smokers) exceeds benchmark success rates reported in the literature for other, comparably intensive interventions, suggesting that a couple-focused intervention different in concept and format from social-support interventions tested in the past may hold promise for health-compromised smokers. The12-month cessation rates were 40% for primary smokers and 63% for secondary smokers.
 The FAMCON approach appeared particularly well-suited to female smokers and smokers whose partner also smoked – two sub-groups at high risk for relapse.

 Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is used for the treatment of end-stage renal disease in approximately 25% of patients requiring dialysis in Canada. The most common PD related complication is infective peritonitis, a syndrome of acute pain, cloudy peritoneal dialysate, and infection. Although many cases of peritonitis can be treated as an outpatient, recurrent or unresolving infections can result in fibrotic changes in the peritoneal membrane, catheter removal or patient death. Gram positive organisms are amongst the commonest causes of PD peritonitis; however, recent trends show an increasing rate of gram negative and fungal infections. Strategies to prevent peritonitis include the use of prophylactic topical mupirocin at the site where the PD catheter exits from the abdominal wall. Despite this and other innovations peritonitis is still diagnosed, on average, in one patient out of every 24 patients followed for a month. The aim of this study is to determine if the incidence of catheter related infections (exit site infection, tunnel infection or peritonitis) is significantly reduced by the routine application of Polysporin Triple in comparison to mupirocin ointment.A multi-centre randomized double blind, controlled study is proposed.
 Polysporin Triple will be compared against the current standard of care. All patients currently being treated with, or starting onto, peritoneal dialysis will be eligible.
 Participants will be randomized to one of two treatment arms (mupirocin; Polysporin Triple) and stratified according to a) centre b) vintage (incident versus prevalent), and c) type of
 PD (chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis vs. automated PD). Patients will be followed for 18 months or until the first catheter related infection, death or catheter removal due to technique failure. Catheter related infections will be strictly defined using current guidelines and categorized into exit site infections, infective peritonitis or tunnel infections."

 HSPC mobilization is normally achieved using cytokines such as G-CSF, or occasionally GM-CSF, often in combination with myelosuppressive chemotherapy.
 Studies in the mouse model have shown that retinoids (vitamin A derivatives) can be combined with G-CSF, and that this combination synergizes to enhance HSPC mobilization over that seen with G-CSF alone.
 This trial aims to assess the safety and mobilization efficacy of combining mobilizing doses of G-CSF with a standard dose of ATRA, using a treatment regimen derived from the earlier murine studies.
 In this phase I pilot study, six patients with multiple myeloma or cutaneous lymphoma will be treated with ATRA plus G-CSF, and safety and toxicity data collected for the two week study drug period plus a further two weeks' follow-up. The primary endpoint is safety and toxicity, the secondary endpoint is an observation of the mobilization efficacy as demonstrated by
 CD34+ cell counts over the study period. Patients will not undergo stem cell collection during this study, as this is purely an observational study. Participating patients will not be those who would normally be scheduled for stem cell collection and transplantation in the near future, but rather patients with stable disease who are not candidates for imminent transplantation, or who have collected adequate HSPC on previous mobilization attempts and are currently being observed.
 Cutaneous lymphoma and multiple myeloma are chosen as suitable disease states for this study as there is in vitro evidence of a possible disease benefit of retinoids in these disorders.
 If disease response is noted during the study or follow up period, ongoing ATRA will be offered at the discretion of the treating physician."

 Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) is a common health problem with three or more loses affecting 1-2% and two or more losses affecting up to 5% of women at the reproductive age (Brenner 2003).
 Several aetiologies have been identified or are under discussion to play a role in RPL, including chromosomal translocations and inversions, anatomic alterations of the uterus, endocrinological abnormalities, autoimmune disorders infection, smoking and alcohol consumption, exposure to environmental factors as well as coagulation and immunoregulatory defects (Pandey 2005, Lee 2000). About 30-40% of cases of RPL remain unexplained after standard gynaecological, hormonal and karyotype analysis (Rey 2000).
 As stated by Pandey et al (Pandey 2005), a successful implantation during pregnancy requires a balanced equilibrium between coagulation, fibrinolysis and vascular remodeling by the process of angiogenesis in order to avoid excess fibrin accumulation in placental vessels and intervillous spaces (Buchholz 2003). However, thrombosis in decidual vessels is reported to be one of the major causes of RPL (Arias 1998) and could be explained by excessive thrombosis of the placental vessels, placental infarction, and secondary uteroplacental insufficiency.
 Recurrent pregnancy loss is a well-described complication of the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome and is thought to be associated with thrombosis of placental vessels, often with evidence for placental infarction. More recently, inherited thrombophilic abnormalities have been linked to RPL and other obstetric complications. At least 16 case-control studies found a high prevalence of factor V Leiden (FVL) in women with unexplained RPL (up to 30%) compared to 1% to 10% of control subjects with odds ratios ranging from 2 to 5 (Press et al. 2002).
 Likewise, other thrombophilic risk factors including factor II G20210A, hyperhomocysteinemia, protein C, protein S and antithrombin deficiencies have also been associated with RPL (Sanson 1996; Brenner 1999).
 A meta-analysis of Rey et al. (Rey 2003) including 31 case control, cohort and cross-sectional studies, showed an association between thrombophilia and fetal loss, though the magnitude varies according to type of fetal loss and type of thrombophilia.
 Although most pregnancy losses occur in the first trimester, women with thrombophilia are at an increased risk for pregnancy loss in the second and third trimesters. A number of studies found that FVL carriers have a significantly higher risk of late pregnancy loss than early first trimester loss (Sarig 2002; Meinardi 1999). One possible explanation is that late pregnancy losses may reflect thrombosis of placental vessels. However, the majority of pregnancy losses in women with thrombophilia still occur in the first trimester (Sarig 2002;
 Younis 2000). The mechanisms responsible for the association of inherited thrombophilia with
 RPL have not been fully elucidated. Pathological studies of placentas obtained from gestations terminated by foetal loss reveal thrombotic changes and infarcts. These can be observed at the maternal vessels in 50-90% of placentae of women with stillbirth (Gris 1999;
 Many 2001). However, these changes can also be found in a significant proportion of women with RPL without thrombophilia (Gris 1999; Martinelli 2000). Raising the possibility of yet undetermined gestational prothrombotic risk factors either at fetal vessels or at maternal vessels. A role for foetoplacental thrombosis has been suggested by studies demonstrating an association between factor V genotype in miscarried foetuses and placental infarction.
 However, the findings of thrombotic changes at the maternal side and the efficacy of LMWH, which do not cross the placentae, in preventing foetal loss are in support with the latter.
 Emerging data on therapy of women with inherited thrombophilia and pregnancy loss is mostly uncontrolled and include small series of patients treated mainly with LMWH. The potential advantages of LMWH over unfractionated heparin are higher antithrombotic ratio, meaning less bleeding for better antithrombotic effect, longer half-life with a potential need for only one injection per day, smaller injected volume and less heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.
 These advantages are particularly appealing for prolonged prophylaxis throughout pregnancy and the postpartum period. A recent collaborative study has demonstrated the safety of using
 LMWH during 486 gestations (Sanson 1999). Successful outcome was reported in 83/93 (89%) gestations in women with recurrent pregnancy loss and in all 28 gestations in women with preeclampsia in previous pregnancy.
 Since novel inherited and acquired prothrombotic abnormalities are currently under investigation, clinicians often address the question of prophylaxis in women with RPL who do not have a specific thrombophilic defect. The encouraging results presented above let rise the clinical practise of LMWH therapy without the proved evidence in women without thrombophilic disorders. To give the basis for a rational therapy this question should be answered by this prospective randomized trial."

 This is a phase I study of second primary tumor prevention in early stage (stage I/II) patients diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN).
 The study will evaluate the effect on cells and clinical response to study medications:
 Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR), Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor Erlotinib (OSI-774,
 Tarceva™), and Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) Inhibitor (Celecoxib). The side effects of the medications will be assessed, and chemicals in the cells will be evaluated both before and after medication is administered that may show how the drugs work. This information will help researchers determine whether additional studies with these drugs should be conducted to determine if the drugs can help prevent pre-cancerous lesions from becoming cancerous.
 SCCHN accounts for 5% of all cancer, and there is an incidence of approximately 37,200 new cases in the United States per year with 11,000 deaths. The five-year survival rate for patients with SCCHN in the United States and other developed countries is still poor, approximately 40%, comparable to the five-year survival rate in the 1970s despite advances in detection, surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. Thus, a preventative approach before the development of invasive cancer or second primary tumors (SPTs) is highly desirable and novel strategies to reduce cancer incidence in SCCHN and other tobacco-carcinogen related malignancies are being pursued."

The study consisted of a 14-day period for randomization, dose-titration, and stabilization, followed by a 4-week maintenance phase. Eligible patients were randomized equally to begin therapy with either
 OROS hydromorphone HCL 8 mg daily or OxyContin 10 mg twice daily. Upward dose titration (doses with increase in titration) from the starting doses was allowed every 2 days, based on pain relief and opioid-related side effects. The dose was to have been titrated to provide the best balance between pain relief and side effects. After 14 days, if therapeutic efficacy with dose stabilization had been documented, the patient was allowed to begin the 4-week maintenance phase. The expected primary efficacy variable endpoints were: The mean pain relief score at endpoint defined as the mean of the last 2 non missing pain relief scores during the Maintenance Phase, and the days from study medication initiation to the third day of moderate to complete pain relief on the patient's final titrated dose (as reported in the patient diary) during the Randomization, Titration and Stabilization Phase.

 Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a disease characterized by one or more symptoms of hyperactivity, impulsivity, or inattention that interfere with school, home, work, or social settings. ADHD does not have clear physical signs that can be seen in an x-ray or a lab test. The disorder only can be identified by looking for certain behaviors, which vary from person to person.
 This trial will compare the benefits and side effects of two medications——clonidine and methylphenidate (MPH)——used alone or in combination to treat ADHD in children. MPH is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of ADHD symptoms in children, and clonidine is FDA-approved for the treatment of hypertension in adults.
 Stimulant medications such as MPH are known to safely and effectively treat many ADHD symptoms. Such medicines, however, do not cure the condition or improve all ADHD symptoms, and the long-term effectiveness of these medications is not well-known.

 This is a single centre phase I/II study which will be conducted in two stages. The ability of AMD3100 to augment the antileukemic effect of chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation in patients with MDS or with AML in first or subsequent relapse, second or greater remission or primary induction failure will be assessed.
 The primary objective in Stage 1 is to determine an acceptably safe dose, utilizing the continual reassessment method (CRM).The CRM is a model-based statistical procedure for conducting phase I clinical trials that assigns doses to successive cohorts of patients based on the doses given and outcomes observed (toxicity or no toxicity) of all previous patients.
 In this sense, the method is outcome-adaptive. The CRM relies on a simple Bayesian model for the probability of toxicity as a function of dose. As the dose-toxicity data in the trial accumulate the Bayesian model learns about the relationship between dose and probability of toxicity. Numerous computer simulation studies (and the references therein) have shown that the CRM has greatly superior properties compared to conventional 3+3 algorithms. This is due to the facts that conventional algorithms are not model-based, they only use data from the most recent 6 patients, and they tend to stop the trial very early, with the consequences that they are very likely to give very unreliable estimates of the toxicity probability at each dose and provide an unreliable recommended maximum tolerated dose (MTD).
 Under the particular version of the CRM being used in this trial, following treatment of the first cohort of three patients at the initial dose level 80 µg/kg, the following decisions are possible:
 -  If 0 of the first 3 patients (#1, 2 and 3) experience toxicity, then the method will escalate and the second cohort of patients (#4, 5 and 6) will be treated at the second dose level, 160 µg/kg.
 -  If either 1 or 2 of the first 3 patients experience toxicity, then the method will stay at the starting dose, so the second cohort will be treated at the lowest dose level, 80 µg/kg.
 -  If all 3 of the first 3 patients experience toxicity, then the posterior probability that the lowest dose is unacceptably toxic will be 0.951, and since this exceeds the decision cut-off 0.90 in the protocol the phase I trial will be terminated with the conclusion that the lowest dose level 80 µg/kg is excessively toxic.
 If the trial continues, for all successive cohorts after the first, since the decision of which dose to assign utilizes all of the dose-toxicity data from all patients treated previously, there are too many possibilities to enumerate. For example, there are 12 possible outcomes for the second cohort, and this number increases exponentially as the trial progresses. However, at any point in the trial, the estimated probability of toxicity at each dose based on the most recent data may easily be estimated and this information made available to the investigators. Additional safety provisions are that the middle dose of 160 µg/kg may not be skipped when initially escalating from 80 µg/kg, and the trial will be terminated early with no dose chosen if the lowest dose is excessively toxic.
 The primary objective in Stage 2 is to determine progression free survival post-allogeneic transplant, in terms of time to treatment failure and survival. Stage 1 will include both prognostic subgroups CR and not in complete remission (NCR). In Stage 2, different monitoring rules will be used in CR and NCR subgroups to reflect their very different historical failure rates. Additionally, all patients treated at the dose selected in Stage 1 will be counted as members of the Stage 2 sample."

 Primary Angle Closure Glaucoma (PACG) continues to be a major concern in Asia. It is a major cause of visual morbidity in the region1 being the most prevalent type of glaucoma especially in Chinese and Mongoloid descent.2,3 During the acute stage of the disease, prompt institution of measures to break the attack is necessary. Two recognized approaches are utilized in practice in lowering intraocular pressure and preparing for the definitive treatment of laser peripheral iridotomy. These are conventional topical and systemic medical therapy and immediate peripheral iridoplasty using either argon or diode lasers.
 In the study of Lim, Tan, Chew, Seah et al., laser iridoplasty was noted to have a useful role in the management of medically unresponsive acute angle closure, particularly in those cases where laser peripheral iridotomy (PI) could not be successfully performed4 . Randomized controlled trials of Lam, Lai, Tham et al. comparing immediate laser peripheral iridoplasty plus topical medications and topical and systemic medical treatment found no significant difference in the eventual mean IOP and requirement for glaucoma medications 5 . However, significant difference in efficacy was observed between the two treatment arms within the first two hours of treatment with argon laser peripheral iridoplasty and topical medications lowering IOP faster than conventional medications6. In all the trials cited, there was no mention of sudden IOP lowering effects of either argon laser iridoplasty or conventional medications on the optic nerve head and visual field status, as well as its effect on other ocular structures like the cornea, lens and retina . In our literature search, two papers studied the optic nerve head structure and function in angle closure glaucoma, but not in the immediate period of sudden IOP lowering. Ang, Aung, Chua, Yip and Chew made a comparative assessment of the visual field loss between symptomatic and asymptomatic PACG, with 50% of asymptomatic PACG subjects presenting with end stage visual field loss in contrast to just 7% of symptomatic PACG.7 Lai, Tham, Lam et al. compared the retinal nerve fiber layer measurements of attack eyes and their fellow eyes after a single unilateral attack of acute primary angle closure (APAC) using scanning laser polarimetry six months after the acute attack8. Retinal nerve fiber layer damage was documented in eyes where the duration of the
 APAC attack lasted more than 48 hours8. Decompression retinopathy following laser peripheral iridoplasty for acute primary angle closure was reported in two cases reported by Lai, Lee,
 Leung and Chung.9 In order to compare the efficiency of laser peripheral iridoplasty and medical treatment, as well as to identify any morbidity that may come from sudden decompression of the eye, we undertake this randomized controlled trial."

 Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a serious condition that can interfere with a person's ability to work, study, sleep, eat, and enjoy activities that were once pleasurable.
 Depression may occur only once in a lifetime, but usually occurs several times. There are several types of medications and therapies that have been successful in improving symptoms of depression. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has been particularly successful in treating individuals whose depression is severe or life threatening or who cannot take antidepressant medication. In ECT, electrodes are placed at precise locations on the head to deliver electrical impulses. The stimulation causes a brief seizure within the brain. The person receiving ECT does not consciously experience the electrical stimulus and does not feel pain.
 This study will compare four types of ECT to determine if they differ in their effects on mood, thinking, brain activity, and biochemistry in people with MDD.
 Participants in this double-blind study will be randomly assigned to receive one of four types of ECT. Treatments will occur three times a week for 2 to 6 weeks, depending on each participant's individual needs. All participants will stop taking any psychiatric medications at least 5 days before receiving ECT. Before beginning each ECT session, participants will be interviewed by study staff about their current psychiatric condition, any psychological problems they have had, any history of psychological problems in their families, their medical history, and their attitudes about receiving ECT. A family member may also be asked to participate in some interviews. In addition, before each treatment, monitoring sensors will be placed on each participant's head and other areas of the body and a blood pressure cuff will be placed on an arm. These devices will be used to monitor each participant's brain waves, heart, and blood pressure before, during, and after treatment.
 Because ECT entails the use of general anesthesia, participants will not eat for at least 8 hours before each treatment. An intravenous catheter will be placed in participants' arms to administer the anesthesia and a muscle relaxant. Just before receiving ECT, participants will be asked to remember a set of information. Upon waking after treatment, participants will be asked to recall or recognize this material and complete a set of brief neuropsychological tasks. Electroencephalogram (EEG) tests (to measure electrical activity of the brain), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) (to measure muscle activity), blood collection, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) tests (to image the inside of the body) will be performed at selected sessions and follow-up visits to assess outcomes. Follow-up interviews will be held via telephone every 2 weeks for 2 months post-treatment, and then monthly for the remainder of the year. Follow-up neuropsychological tests will also be administered at Months 2, 4, and 6 post-treatment."

 After endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, life-long follow-up is needed to monitor the effectiveness of exclusion of the aneurysm sac from blood flow. For this reason, aneurysm diameter and the presence of endoleaks is evaluated with computed tomographic (CT) angiography yearly after Endovascular Aneurysm Repair (EVAR).
 The aim of this study is to investigate the value of magnetic resonance imaging using
 Vasovist as a contrast agent for the detection of endoleaks.
 The advantages of magnetic resonance imaging with respect to CTA are no use of ionizing radiation, use of less nephrotoxic contrast agents."

 OBJECTIVES:
 Primary
 -  Determine the change in melanoma intratumoral infiltrates by CD8 positive cytotoxic T lymphocytes in patients with stage IIIC or IV melanoma treated with ticilimumab (CP-675,206).
 Secondary
 -  Determine the effects of this drug on intratumoral immune effector cells and tumor cells in these patients.
 -  Determine the effects of this drug on circulating immune effector cells in these patients.
 -  Determine the gene expression profile of immune effector cells and tumor cells in regressing and nonregressing tumors in these patients.
 -  Bank plasma from peripheral blood obtained from patients with regressing and nonregressing tumors for future exploratory analysis of proteomic profile.
 -  Assess additional evidence of antitumor activity of this drug, as measured by best on-study response rate, in these patients.
 -  Characterize the safety profile and tolerability of this drug in these patients.
 -  Obtain pharmacokinetic data to be used in a future meta-analysis of this drug's pharmacokinetics.
 -  Determine whether the CTLA4 genotype influences the safety, immune response, and/or efficacy of this drug in these patients.
 -  Determine the relationships between clinical response (i.e., efficacy or toxicity) and tumor and/or blood ex vivo analysis in patients treated with this drug.
 OUTLINE: This is an open-label, randomized study.
 Patients receive ticilimumab (CP-675,206) IV over 2 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 90 days for up to 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
 Patients undergo blood collection periodically during study for correlative pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacogenetic, and pharmacogenomic analyses. Blood specimens are obtained for PK measurement at baseline and periodically during study treatment for analysis by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Blood specimens are also evaluated by pharmacogenetic assessment of polymorphisms in CTLA4. Patients also undergo leukapheresis at baseline and at least once between days 30-60 for biomarker analysis of immune cell activation (i.e., CD45RO, CD45RA,
 HLA-DR, CCR5, CCR7, CD62L, CD69); Treg phenotype (i.e., CD4/CD25/GITR/intracellular FoxP3); and Treg function. In HLA-A2.1 positive patients, PBMC are analyzed for antigen-specific immune reactivity by MART-1, gp100, and tyrosine MHC tetramer using enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assay. Plasma obtained during leukapheresis is assessed for levels of circulating cytokines and chemokines. Some plasma is stored for future proteomic profile analysis.
 Patients also undergo excisional or punch biopsy at baseline and between days 30-60 during course 1. Tumor tissue samples embedded in paraffin are analyzed by hematoxylin-eosin and immunohistochemical staining for several biomarkers, including biomarkers of immune cell response (i.e., CD3, CD4, and CD8) and biomarkers of melanoma (i.e., S-100, MART-1, and/or
 HMB45). Frozen tumor tissue samples are analyzed by gene chips and gene arrays for gene expression profile and by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction for FoxP3. Minced tumor tissue samples are analyzed by flow cytometry in nonadherent cells for HLA-DR (if tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes are available) and by Braf sequencing in adherent cells (if melanoma cells are available).
 After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 6 months.
 PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 21 patients will be accrued for this study."

 The purpose of this study is to measure the efficacy of topical diclofenac to topical placebo in the symptomatic relief of degenerative temporomandibular joint disease in a female population between the ages of 18-45 years of age.
 Primary Objectives:
 -  To compare the efficacy of placebo and diclofenac topical PLO gel in terms of functional pain intensity of symptomatic temporomandibular degenerative joint disease in participants by comparing baseline measures obtained prior to commencement of the study, with the measurements obtained at 30, 60 and 90 days during the treatment intervention through the use of a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS).
 Secondary Objectives:
 -  To compare the efficacy of placebo and diclofenac topical in PLO gel in terms of measurement of the range of motion of voluntary and assisted vertical jaw opening of symptomatic temporomandibular degenerative joint disease (TMDJD) in participants by comparing baseline measures obtained prior to commencement of the study, Time 0, through the use of a 100 mm ruler to measures obtained at 30, 60 and 90 days during the treatment intervention.
 -  To compare the efficacy of placebo and diclofenac in terms of effect on quality of life of symptomatic TMDJD in participants by comparing baseline measures obtained prior to commencement of the study, Time 0, to measures obtained after 90 consecutive days of treatment, utilizing a subsection of The Brief Pain Inventory Scale (BPI) which relates to quality of life.
 -  To compare the efficacy of placebo and diclofenac in terms of effect on pain intensity of symptomatic TMDJD in participants by comparing baseline measures obtained prior to commencement of the study, Time 0, to measures obtained after 90 consecutive days of treatment, utilizing a subsection of The Brief Pain Inventory Scale (BPI) (Cleeland &
 Ryan, 1994) which relates to pain intensity.
 -  To compare the efficacy of placebo and diclofenac topical PLO gel in terms of effect on disability on specific activities of daily living of TMDJD participants by comparing baseline measures obtained prior to the commencement of the study, Time 0, to that obtained after 90 consecutive day of treatment, utilizing The Pain Disability Index (PDI) (Bush & Harkin, 1995).
 Tertiary Objectives
 -  To compare the adverse effects documented by the topical diclofenac group to those documented by the topical placebo group.
 -  To compare the amount of breakthrough medication used by the topical diclofenac group versus the placebo group in order to assess if the use of topical diclofenac reduces the amount of oral medication.
 -  To compare reasons for withdrawal from the study between topical placebo and topical diclofenac groups.
 The null hypothesis is that there is no difference between the efficacy of topical diclofenac and topical placebo in the treatment of degenerative temporomandibular joint disease."
