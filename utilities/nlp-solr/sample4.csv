"",,,,,,,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 68-year-old woman whom I have been following, who has had angina. In any case today, she called me because she had a recurrent left arm pain after her stent, three days ago, and this persisted after two sublingual nitroglycerin when I spoke to her. I advised her to call 911, which she did. While waiting for 911, she was attended to by a physician who is her neighbor and he advised her to take the third nitroglycerin and that apparently relieved her pain. By the time she presented here, she is currently pain-free and is feeling well.

PAST CARDIAC HISTORY: The patient has been having arm pain for several months. She underwent an exercise stress echocardiogram within the last several months with me, which was equivocal, but then she had a nuclear stress test which showed inferobasilar ischemia. I had originally advised her for a heart catheterization but she wanted medical therapy, so we put her on a beta-blocker. However, her arm pain symptoms accelerated and she had some jaw pain, so she presented to the emergency room. On 08/16/08, she ended up having a cardiac catheterization and that showed normal left main 80% mid LAD lesion, circumflex normal, and RCA totally occluded in the mid portion and there were collaterals from the left to the right, as well as right to right to that area. The decision was made to transfer her as she may be having collateral insufficiency from the LAD stenosis to the RCA vessel. She underwent that with drug-eluting stents on 08/16/08, with I believe three or four total placed, and was discharged on 08/17/08. She had some left arm discomfort on 08/18/08, but this was mild. Yesterday, she felt very fatigued, but no arm pain, and today, she had arm pain after walking and again it resolved now completely after three sublingual nitroglycerin. This is her usual angina. She is being admitted with unstable angina post stent.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Longstanding hypertension, CAD as above, hyperlipidemia, and overactive bladder.

MEDICATIONS:
1. Detrol LA 2 mg once a day.
2. Prilosec for GERD 20 mg once a day.
3. Glucosamine 500/400 mg once a day for arthritis.
4. Multivitamin p.o. daily.
5. Nitroglycerin sublingual as available to her.
6. Toprol-XL 25 mg once a day which I started although she had been bradycardic, but she seems to be tolerating.
7. Aspirin 325 mg once a day.
8. Plavix 75 mg once a day.
9. Diovan 160 mg once a day.
10. Claritin 10 mg once a day for allergic rhinitis.
11. Norvasc 5 mg once a day.
12. Lipitor 5 mg once a day.
13. Evista 60 mg once a day.

ALLERGIES: ALLERGIES TO MEDICATIONS ARE NONE. SHE DENIES ANY SHRIMP OR SEA FOOD ALLERGY.

FAMILY HISTORY: Her father died of an MI in his 50s and a brother had his first MI and bypass surgery at 54.

SOCIAL HISTORY: She does not smoke cigarettes, abuse alcohol, no use of illicit drugs. She is divorced and lives alone and is a retired laboratory technician from Cornell Diagnostic Laboratory.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: She denies a history of stroke, cancer, vomiting up blood, coughing up blood, bright red blood per rectum, bleeding stomach ulcers, renal calculi, cholelithiasis, asthma, emphysema, pneumonia, tuberculosis, home oxygen use or sleep apnea, although she has been told in the past that she snores and there was some question of apnea in 05/08. No morning headaches or fatigue. No psychiatric diagnosis. No psoriasis, no lupus. Remainder of the review of systems is negative x14 systems except as described above.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
GENERAL: She is a pleasant elderly woman, currently in no acute distress.
VITAL SIGNS: Height 4 feet 11 inches, weight 128 pounds, temperature 97.2 degrees Fahrenheit, blood pressure 142/70, pulse 47, respiratory rate 16, and O2 saturation 100%
HEENT: Cranium is normocephalic and atraumatic. She has moist mucosal membranes.
NECK: Veins are not distended. There are no carotid bruits.
LUNGS: Clear to auscultation and percussion without wheezes.
HEART: S1 and S2, regular rate. No significant murmurs, rubs or gallops. PMI nondisplaced.
ABDOMEN: Soft and nondistended. Bowel sounds present.
EXTREMITIES: Without significant clubbing, cyanosis or edema. Pulses grossly intact. Bilateral groins are inspected, status post as the right femoral artery was used for access for the diagnostic cardiac catheterization here and left femoral artery used for PCI and there is no evidence of hematoma or bruit and intact distal pulses.

LABORATORY DATA: EKG reviewed which shows sinus bradycardia at the rate of 51 beats per minute and no acute disease.

Sodium 136, potassium 3.8, chloride 105, and bicarbonate 27. BUN 16 and creatinine 0.9. Glucose 110. Magnesium 2.5. ALT 107 and AST 65 and these were normal on 08/15/08. INR is 0.89, PTT 20.9, white blood cell count 8.2, hematocrit 31 and it was 35 on 08/15/08, and platelet count 257,000.

IMPRESSION AND PLAN: The patient is a 68-year-old woman with exertional angina, characterized with arm pain, who underwent recent left anterior descending percutaneous coronary intervention and has now had recurrence of that arm pain post stenting to the left anterior descending artery and it may be that she is continuing to have collateral insufficiency of the right coronary artery. In any case, given this unstable presentation requiring three sublingual nitroglycerin before she was even pain free, I am going to admit her to the hospital and there is currently no evidence requiring acute reperfusion therapy. We will continue her beta-blocker and I cannot increase the dose because she is bradycardic already. Aspirin, Plavix, valsartan, Lipitor, and Norvasc. I am going to add Imdur and watch headaches as she apparently had some on nitro paste before, and we will rule out MI, although there is a little suspicion. I suppose it is possible that she has non-cardiac arm pain, but that seems less likely as it has been nitrate responsive and seems exertionally related and the other possibility may be that we end up needing to put in a pacemaker, so we can maximize beta-blocker use for anti-anginal effect. My concern is that there is persistent right coronary artery ischemia, not helped by left anterior descending percutaneous coronary intervention, which was severely stenotic and she does have normal LV function. She will continue the glucosamine for her arthritis, Claritin for allergies, and Detrol LA for urinary incontinence.

Total patient care time in the emergency department 75 minutes. All this was discussed in detail with the patient and her daughter who expressed understanding and agreement. The patient desires full resuscitation status.

"",,,,,,,"EXAM: Bilateral diagnostic mammogram, left breast ultrasound and biopsy.

HISTORY: 30-year-old female presents for digital bilateral mammography secondary to a soft tissue lump palpated by the patient in the upper right shoulder. The patient has a family history of breast cancer within her mother at age 58. Patient denies personal history of breast cancer.

TECHNIQUE AND FINDINGS: Craniocaudal and mediolateral oblique projections of bilateral breasts were obtained on mm/dd/yy. An additional lateromedial projection of the right breast was obtained. The breasts demonstrate heterogeneously-dense fibroglandular tissue. Within the upper outer aspect of the left breast, there is evidence of a circumscribed density measuring approximately 1 cm x 0.7 cm in diameter. No additional dominant mass, areas of architectural distortion, or malignant-type calcifications are seen. Multiple additional benign-appearing calcifications are visualized bilaterally. Skin overlying both breasts is unremarkable.

Bilateral breast ultrasound was subsequently performed, which demonstrated an ovoid mass measuring approximately 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm in diameter located within the anteromedial aspect of the left shoulder. This mass demonstrates isoechoic echotexture to the adjacent muscle, with no evidence of internal color flow. This may represent benign fibrous tissue or a lipoma.

Additional ultrasonographic imaging of the left breast demonstrates a complex circumscribed solid and cystic lesion with hypervascular properties at the 2 o'clock position, measuring 0.7 x 0.7 x 0.8 cm in diameter. At this time, the lesion was determined to be amenable by ultrasound-guided core biopsy.

The risks and complications of the procedure were discussed with the patient for biopsy of the solid and cystic lesion of the 2 o'clock position of the left breast. Informed consent was obtained. The lesion was re-localized under ultrasound guidance. The left breast was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. 2% lidocaine was administered locally for anesthesia. Additional lidocaine with epinephrine was administered around the distal aspect of the lesion. A small skin nick was made. Color Doppler surrounding the lesion demonstrates multiple vessels surrounding the lesion at all sides. The lateral to medial approach was performed with an 11-gauge Mammotome device. The device was advanced under ultrasound guidance, with the superior aspect of the lesion placed within the aperture. Two core biopsies were obtained. The third core biopsy demonstrated evidence of an expanding hypoechoic area surrounding the lesion, consistent with a rapidly-expanding hematoma. Arterial blood was visualized exiting the access site. A biopsy clip was attempted to be placed, however could not be performed secondary to the active hemorrhage. Therefore, the Mammotome was removed, and direct pressure over the access site and biopsy location was applied for approximately 20 minutes until hemostasis was achieved. Postprocedural imaging of the 2 o'clock position of the left breast demonstrates evidence of a hematoma measuring approximately 1.9 x 4.4 x 1.3 cm in diameter. The left breast was re-cleansed with a ChloraPrep, and a pressure bandage and ice packing were applied to the left breast. The patient was observed in the ultrasound department for the following 30 minutes without complaints. The patient was subsequently discharged with information and instructions on utilizing the ice bandage. The obtained specimens were sent to pathology for further analysis.

IMPRESSION:
1. A mixed solid and cystic lesion at the 2 o'clock position of the left breast was accessed under ultrasound guidance utilizing a Mammotome core biopsy instrument, and multiple core biopsies were obtained. Transient arterial hemorrhage was noted at the biopsy site, resulting in a localized 4 cm hematoma. Pressure was applied until hemostasis was achieved. The patient was monitored for approximately 30 minutes after the procedure, and was ultimately discharged in good condition. The core biopsies were submitted to pathology for further analysis.
2. Small isoechoic ovoid mass within the anteromedial aspect of the left shoulder does not demonstrate color flow, and likely represents fibrotic changes or a lipoma.
3. Suspicious mammographic findings. The circumscribed density measuring approximately 8 mm at the 2 o'clock position of the left breast was subsequently biopsied. Further pathologic analysis is pending.

BIRADS Classification 4 - Suspicious findings.

MAMMOGRAPHY INFORMATION:
1. A certain percentage of cancers, probably 10% to 15%, will not be identified by mammography.
2. Lack of radiographic evidence of malignancy should not delay a biopsy if a clinically suspicious mass is present.
3. These images were obtained with FDA-approved digital mammography equipment, and iCAD SecondLook Software Version 7.2 was utilized.

"",,,,,,,"REASON FOR VISIT: This is a routine return appointment for this 71-year-old woman with chronic atrial fibrillation. Her chief complaint today is shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: I last saw her in 09/2008. Since then, she has been admitted to ABCD Hospital from 11/05/2008 through 11/08/2008 for a near syncopal episode. She was found to have a fast heart rate in the atrial fibrillation. She was also found to be in heart failure and so they diuresed her. They wanted to send her home on furosemide 40 mg daily, but unfortunately they never gave her a prescription for this and so she now is not on any furosemide and since being discharged she has regained fluid to no one's great surprise. My plan advent is to control her heart rate. This has been a bit difficult with her retaining fluid. We will try again to diurese her as an outpatient and go forward from there with rate control and anticoagulation. She may need to have a pacemaker placed and her AV node ablated if this does not work.

She notes the shortness of breath and wheezing at nights. I think these are manifestations of heart failure. She has peripheral edema. She is short of breath when she tries to walk a city block. I believe she takes her medications as directed, but I am never sure she actually is taking them correctly. In any case, she did not bring her medications with her today.

Today, she had an ECG which shows atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response of 117 beats per minute. There is a nonspecific IVCD. This is unchanged from her last visit except that her heart rate is faster. In addition, I reviewed her echocardiogram done at XYZ. Her ejection fraction is 50% and she has paradoxical septal motion. Her right ventricular systolic pressure is normal. There are no significant valvular abnormalities.

MEDICATIONS:
1. Fosamax - 70 mg weekly.
2. Lisinopril - 20 mg daily.
3. Metformin - 850 mg daily.
4. Amlodipine - 5 mg daily.
5. Metoprolol - 150 mg twice daily.
6. Warfarin - 5 mg daily.
7. Furosemide - none.
8. Potassium - none.
9. Magnesium oxide - 200 mg daily.

ALLERGIES: Denied.

MAJOR FINDINGS: On my comprehensive cardiovascular examination, she again looks the same which is in heart failure. Her blood pressure today was 130/60 and her pulse 116 blood pressure and regular. She is 5 feet 11 inches and her weight is 167 pounds, which is up from 158 pounds from when I saw her last visit. She is breathing 1two times per minute and it is unlabored. Eyelids are normal. She has vitiligo. Pupils are round and reactive to light. Conjunctivae are clear and sclerae are anicteric. There is no oral thrush or central cyanosis. She has marked keloid formation on both sides of her neck, the left being worse than the right. The jugular venous pressure is elevated. Carotids are brisk are without bruits. Lungs are clear to auscultation and percussion. The precordium is quiet. The rhythm is irregularly irregular. She has a variable first and second heart sounds. No murmurs today. Abdomen is soft without hepatosplenomegaly or masses, although she does have hepatojugular reflux. She has no clubbing or cyanosis, but does have 1+ peripheral edema. Distal pulses are good. On neurological examination, her mentation is normal. Her mood and affect are normal. She is oriented to person, place, and time.

ASSESSMENTS: She has chronic atrial fibrillation and heart failure now.

PROBLEMS DIAGNOSES:
1. Chronic atrial fibrillation, anticoagulated and the plan is rate control.
2. Heart failure and she needs more diuretic.
3. High blood pressure controlled.
4. Hyperlipidemia.
5. Diabetes mellitus type 2.
6. Nonspecific intraventricular conduction delay.
7. History of alcohol abuse.
8. Osteoporosis.
9. Normal left ventricular function.

PROCEDURES AND IMMUNIZATIONS: None today.

PLANS: I have restarted her Lasix at 80 mg daily and I have asked her to return in about 10 days to the heart failure clinic. There, I would like them to recheck her heart rate and if still elevated, and she is truly on 150 mg of metoprolol twice a day, one could switch her amlodipine from 5 mg daily to diltiazem 120 mg daily. If this does not work, in terms of controlling her heart rate, then she will need to have a pacemaker and her AV node ablated.

Thank you for asking me to participate in her care.

"",,,,,,,"CHIEF COMPLAINT: The patient is a 49-year-old Caucasian male transported to the emergency room by his wife, complaining of shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is known by the nursing staff here to have a long history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and emphysema. He has made multiple visits in the past. Today, the patient presents himself in severe respiratory distress. His wife states that since his recent admission of three weeks ago for treatment of pneumonia, he has not seemed to be able to recuperate, and has persistent complaints of shortness of breath.

Today, his symptoms worsened and she brought him to the emergency room. To the best of her knowledge, there has been no fever. He has persistent chronic cough, as always. More complete history cannot be taken because of the patient’s acute respiratory decompensation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hypertension and emphysema.

MEDICATIONS: Lotensin and some water pill as well as, presumably, an Atrovent inhaler.

ALLERGIES: None are known.

HABITS: The patient is unable to cooperate with the history.

SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives in the local area with his wife.

REVIEW OF BODY SYSTEMS: Unable, secondary to the patient’s condition.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
VITAL SIGNS: Temperature 96 degrees, axillary. Pulse 128. Respirations 48. Blood pressure 156/100. Initial oxygen saturations on room air are 80.
GENERAL: Reveals a very anxious, haggard and exhausted-appearing male, tripoding, with labored breathing.
HEENT: Head is normocephalic and atraumatic.
NECK: The neck is supple without obvious jugular venous distention.
LUNGS: Auscultation of the chest reveals very distant and faint breath sounds, bilaterally, without obvious rales.
HEART: Cardiac examination reveals sinus tachycardia, without pronounced murmur.
ABDOMEN: Soft to palpation.
Extremities: Without edema.

DIAGNOSTIC DATA: White blood count 25.5, hemoglobin 14, hematocrit 42.4, 89 polys, 1 band, 4 lymphocytes. Chemistry panel within normal limits, with the exception of sodium of 124, chloride 81, CO2 44, BUN 6, creatinine 0.7, glucose 182, albumin 3.3 and globulin 4.1. Troponin is 0.11. Urinalysis reveals yellow clear urine. Specific gravity greater than 1.030 with 2+ ketones, 1+ blood and 3+ protein. No white cells and 0-2 red cells.

Chest x-ray suboptimal in quality, but without obvious infiltrates, consolidation or pneumothorax.

CRITICAL CARE NOTE: Critical care one hour.

Shortly after the patient’s initial assessment, the patient apparently began to complain of chest pain and appeared to the nurse to have mounting exhaustion and respiratory distress. Although O2 had been placed, elevating his oxygen saturations to the mid to upper 90s, he continued to complain of symptoms, as noted above. He became progressively more rapidly obtunded. The patient did receive one gram of magnesium sulfate shortly after his arrival, and the BiPAP apparatus was being readied for his use. However, the patient, at this point, became unresponsive, unable to answer questions, and preparations were begun for intubation. The BiPAP apparatus was briefly placed while supplies and medications were assembled for intubation. It was noted that even with the BiPAP apparatus, in the duration of time which was required for transfer of oxygen tubing to the BiPAP mask, the patient’s O2 saturations rapidly dropped to the upper 60 range.

All preparations for intubation having been undertaken, Succinylcholine was ordered, but was apparently unavailable in the department. As the patient was quite obtunded, and while the Dacuronium was being sought, an initial trial of intubation was carried out using a straight blade and a cupped 7.9 endotracheal tube. However, the patient had enough residual muscle tension to make this impractical and further efforts were held pending administration of Dacuronium 10 mg. After approximately two minutes, another attempt at intubation was successful. The cords were noted to be covered with purulent exudates at the time of intubation.

The endotracheal tube, having been placed atraumatically, the patient was initially then nebulated on 100% oxygen, and his O2 saturations rapidly rose to the 90-100% range.

Chest x-ray demonstrated proper placement of the tube. The patient was given 1 mg of Versed, with decrease of his pulse from the 140-180 range to the 120 range, with satisfactory maintenance of his blood pressure.

Because of a complaint of chest pain, which I myself did not hear, during the patient’s initial triage elevation, a trial of Tridil was begun. As the patient’s pressures held in the slightly elevated range, it was possible to push this to 30 mcg per minute. However, after administration of the Dacuronium and Versed, the patient’s blood pressure fell somewhat, and this medication was discontinued when the systolic pressure briefly reached 98.

Because of concern regarding pneumonia or sepsis, the patient received one gram of Rocephin intravenously shortly after the intubation. A nasogastric and Foley were placed, and an arterial blood gas was drawn by respiratory therapy. Dr. X was contacted at this point regarding further orders as the patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit to be placed on the ventilator there. The doctor’s call was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit so he could leave appropriate orders for the patient in addition to my initial orders, which included Albuterol or Atrovent q. 2h. and Levaquin 500 mg IV, as well as Solu-Medrol.

Critical care note terminates at this time.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE: See the critical care note.

MEDICAL DECISION MAKING (DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS): This patient has an acute severe decompensation with respiratory failure. Given the patient’s white count and recent history of pneumonia, the possibility of recurrence of pneumonia is certainly there. Similarly, it would be difficult to rule out sepsis. Myocardial infarction cannot be excluded.

COORDINATION OF CARE: Dr. X was contacted from the emergency room and asked to assume the patient’s care in the Intensive Care Unit.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS: Respiratory failure secondary to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: The patient is to be transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for further management.

"",,,,,,,"ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS:
1. Respiratory arrest.
2 . End-stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
3. Coronary artery disease.
4. History of hypertension.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1. Status post-respiratory arrest.
2. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
3. Congestive heart failure.
4. History of coronary artery disease.
5. History of hypertension.

SUMMARY: The patient is a 49-year-old man who was admitted to the hospital in respiratory distress, and had to be intubated shortly after admission to the emergency room. The patient’s past history is notable for a history of coronary artery disease with prior myocardial infarctions in 1995 and 1999. The patient has recently been admitted to the hospital with pneumonia and respiratory failure. The patient has been smoking up until three to four months previously. On the day of admission, the patient had the sudden onset of severe dyspnea and called an ambulance. The patient denied any gradual increase in wheezing, any increase in cough, any increase in chest pain, any increase in sputum prior to the onset of his sudden dyspnea.

ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
GENERAL: Showed a well-developed, slightly obese man who was in extremis.
NECK: Supple, with no jugular venous distension.
HEART: Showed tachycardia without murmurs or gallops.
PULMONARY: Status showed decreased breath sounds, but no clear-cut rales or wheezes.
EXTREMITIES: Free of edema.

HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the Special Care Unit and intubated. He received intravenous antibiotic therapy with Levaquin. He received intravenous diuretic therapy. He received hand-held bronchodilator therapy. The patient also was given intravenous steroid therapy with Solu-Medrol. The patient’s course was one of gradual improvement, and after approximately three days, the patient was extubated. He continued to be quite dyspneic, with wheezes as well as basilar rales. After pulmonary consultation was obtained, the pulmonary consultant felt that the patient’s overall clinical picture suggested that he had a
significant element of congestive heart failure. With this, the patient was placed on increased doses of Lisinopril and Digoxin, with improvement of his respiratory status. On the day of discharge, the patient had minimal basilar rales; his chest also showed minimal expiratory wheezes; he had no edema; his heart rate was regular; his abdomen was soft; and his neck veins were not distended. It was, therefore, felt that the patient was stable for further management on an outpatient basis.

DIAGNOSTIC DATA: The patient’s admission laboratory data was notable for his initial blood gas, which showed a pH of 7.02 with a pCO2 of 118 and a pO2 of 103. The patient’s electrocardiogram showed nonspecific ST-T wave changes. The patent’s CBC showed a white count of 24,000, with 56% neutrophils and 3% bands.

DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged home.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: His diet was to be a 2 grams sodium, 1800 calorie ADA diet. His medications were to be Prednisone 20 mg twice per day, Theo-24 400 mg per day, Furosemide 40 mg 1-1/2 tabs p.o. per day; Acetazolamide 250 mg one p.o. per day, Lisinopril 20 mg. one p.o. twice per day, Digoxin 0.125 mg one p.o. q.d., nitroglycerin paste 1 inch h.s., K-Dur 60 mEq p.o. b.i.d. He was also to use a Ventolin inhaler every four hours as needed, and Azmacort four puffs twice per day. He was asked to return for follow-up with Dr. X in one to two weeks. Arrangements have been made for the patient to have an echocardiogram for further evaluation of his congestive heart failure later on the day of discharge.

"",,,,,,,"CHIEF COMPLAINT: ""Trouble breathing.""

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: A 37-year-old German woman was brought to a Shock Room at the General Hospital with worsening shortness of breath and cough. Over the year preceding admission, the patient had begun to experience the insidious onset of shortness of breath. She had smoked one half pack of cigarettes per day for 20 years, but had quit smoking approximately 2 months prior to admission. Approximately 2 weeks prior to admission, she noted worsening shortness of breath and the development of a dry nonproductive cough. Approximately 1 week before admission, the shortness of breath became more severe and began to limit her activities. On the day of admission, her dyspnea had worsened to the point that she became markedly short of breath after walking a short distance, and she elected to seek medical attention. On arrival at the hospital, she was short of breath at rest and was having difficulty completing her sentences. She denied orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, swelling in her legs, chest pain, weight loss or gain, fever, chills, palpitations, and sick contacts. She denied any history of IVDA, tattoos, or high risk sexual behavior. She did report a distant history of pulmonary embolism in 1997 with recurrent venous thromboembolism in 1999 for which an IVC filter had been placed in Germany . She had been living in the United States for years, and had had no recent travel. She denied any occupational exposures.

There was extensive increased interstitial density in both the right and left lungs associated with atelectasis in the bilateral bases. There was no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.

ECG: Sinus tachycardia, otherwise normal EKG.

ECHO: The LV was normal in size, wall thickness, and wall motion. The left ventricular systolic function was normal. Estimated EF was 65-69%. The RV was normal in size. The RV systolic function was normal. The left and right atria were normal in size. No intracardiac shunt was present. Trace MR and TR were present. The TR jet was insufficient to assess PA pressures. No pericardial effusion was noted. The transthoracic echocardiogram was interpreted as normal.

HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was stabilized and was admitted to the telemetry unit on supplemental oxygen. The oxygen saturation increased from 88% to 96% on 6 liters-per-minute supplemental O2. The cultures listed below were obtained, and she was started on intravenous antibiotics to cover empirically for community acquired pneumonia. Given her history, she was initially anticoagulated. The diagnostic studies listed above were carried out. A diagnostic procedure was performed.

"",,,,,,,"INDICATION: Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a pleasant 55-year-old white female with multiple myeloma. She is status post chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplant. Latter occurred on 02/05/2007. At that time, she was on telemetry monitor and noticed to be in normal sinus rhythm.

As part of study protocol for investigational drug for prophylaxis against mucositis, she had electrocardiogram performed on 02/06/2007. This demonstrated underlying rhythm of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response at 125 beats per minute. She was subsequently transferred to telemetry for observation. Cardiology consultation was requested. Prior to formal consultation, the patient did have an echocardiogram performed on 02/06/2007, which showed a structurally normal heart with normal left ventricular (LV) systolic function, ejection fraction of 60%, aortic sclerosis without stenosis, a trivial pericardial effusion with no evidence for immunocompromise and mild tricuspid regurgitation with normal pulmonary atrial pressures. Overall, essentially normal heart.

At the time of my evaluation, the patient felt somewhat jittery and nervous, but otherwise asymptomatic.

RECOMMENDATIONS
1. Atrial fibrillation. The patient is currently hemodynamically stable, tolerating her dysrhythmia. However, given the risk of thromboembolic complications, would like to convert to normal sinus rhythm if possible. Given that she was in normal sinus rhythm approximately 24 hours ago, this is relatively acute onset within the last 24 hours. We will initiate therapy with amiodarone 150 mg intravenous (IV) bolus followed by mg/minute at this juncture. If she does not have spontaneous cardioversion, we will consider either electrical cardioversion or anticoagulation with heparin within 24 hours from initiation of amiodarone.
As part of amiodarone protocol, please check TSH. Given her preexisting mild elevation of transaminases, we will follow LFTs closely, while on amiodarone.
2. Thromboembolic risk prophylaxis, as discussed above. No immediate indication for anticoagulation. If however she does not have spontaneous conversion within the next 24 hours, we will need to initiate therapy. This was discussed with Dr. X. Preference would be to run intravenous heparin with PTT of 45 during her thrombocytopenic nadir and initiation of full-dose anticoagulation once nadir is resolved.
3. Congestive heart failure. The patient is clinically euvolemic. Elevated BNP possibly secondary to infarct or renal insufficiency. Follow volume status closely. Follow serial BNPs.
4. Followup. The patient will be followed while in-house, recommendations made as clinically appropriate.

"",,,,,,,"CHIEF COMPLAINT: I have a lot of swelling in my legs.

HISTORY: The patient is a 41-year-old gentleman with a long history of Crohn disease. He has been followed by Dr. ABC, his primary care doctor, but he states that he has had multiple gastroenterology doctors and has not seen one in the past year to 18 months. He has been treated with multiple different medications for his Crohn disease and most recently has been taking pulses of steroids off and on when he felt like he was having symptoms consistent with crampy abdominal pain, increased diarrhea, and low-grade fevers. This has helped in the past, but now he developed symptoms consistent with pneumonia and was admitted to the hospital. He has been treated with IV antibiotics and is growing Streptococcus. At this time, he seems relatively stable although slightly dyspneic. Other symptoms include lower extremity edema, pain in his ankles and knees, and actually symptoms of edema in his entire body including his face and upper extremities. At this time, he continues to have symptoms consistent with diarrhea and malabsorption. He also has some episodes of nausea and vomiting at times. He currently has a cough and symptoms of dyspnea. Further review of systems was not otherwise contributory.

MEDICATIONS:
1. Prednisone.
2. Effexor.
3. Folic acid.
4. Norco for pain.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As mentioned above, but he also has anxiety and depression.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1. Small bowel resections.
2. Appendectomy.
3. A vasectomy.

ALLERGIES: He has no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY: He does smoke two packs of cigarettes per day. He has no alcohol or drug use. He is a painter.

FAMILY HISTORY: Significant for his father who died of IPF and irritable bowel syndrome.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: As mentioned in the history of present illness and further review of systems is not otherwise contributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
GENERAL: He is a thin appearing man in very mild respiratory distress when his oxygen is off.
VITAL SIGNS: His respiratory rate is approximately 18 to 20, his blood pressure is 100/70, his pulse is 90 and regular, he is afebrile currently at 96, and weight is approximately 163 pounds.
HEENT: Sclerae anicteric. Conjunctivae normal. Nasal and oropharynx are clear.
NECK: Supple. No jugular venous pressure distention is noted. There is no adenopathy in the cervical, supraclavicular or axillary areas.
CHEST: Reveals some crackles in the right chest, in the base, and in the upper lung fields. His left is relatively clear with decreased breath sounds.
HEART: Regular rate and rhythm.
ABDOMEN: Slightly protuberant. Bowel sounds are present. He is slightly tender and it is diffuse. There is no organomegaly and no ascites appreciable.
EXTREMITIES: There is a mild scrotal edema and in his lower extremities he has 2 to 3+ edema at pretibial and lateral feet.
DERMATOLOGIC: Shows thin skin. No ecchymosis or petechiae.

LABORATORY STUDIES: Laboratory studies are pertinent for a total protein of 3 and albumin of 1.3. There is no M-spike observed. His B12 is 500 with a folic acid of 11. His white count is 21 with a hemoglobin of 10, and a platelet count 204,000.

IMPRESSION AT THIS TIME:
1. Pneumonia in the face of fairly severe Crohn disease with protein-losing enteropathy and severe malnutrition with anasarca.
2. He also has anemia and leukocytosis, which may be related to his Crohn disease as well as his underlying pneumonia.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: At this time, I believe evaluation of protein intake and dietary supplement will be most appropriate. I believe that he needs a calorie count. We will check on a sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, LDH, prealbumin, thyroid, and iron studies in the morning with his laboratory studies that are already ordered. I have recommended strongly to him that when he is out of the hospital, he return to the care of his gastroenterologist. I will help in anyway that I can to improve the patient's laboratory abnormalities. However, his lower extremity edema is primarily due to his marked hypoalbuminemia and I do not believe that diuretics will help him at this time. I have explained this in detail to the patient and his family. Everybody expresses understanding and all questions were answered. At this time, follow him up during his hospital stay and plan to see him in the office as well.

"",,,,,,,"REASON FOR CONSULTATION: New diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: ABCD is a very nice 47-year-old gentleman without much past medical history who has now been diagnosed with a new non-small cell lung cancer stage IV metastatic disease. We are consulted at this time to discuss further treatment options.

ABCD and his wife state that his history goes back to approximately 2-2-1/2 weeks ago when he developed some left-sided flank pain. Initially, he did not think much of this and tried to go about doing work and everything else but the pain gradually worsened. Eventually this prompted him to present to the emergency room. A CT scan was done there, and he was found to have a large left adrenal mass worrisome for metastatic disease. At that point, he was transferred to XYZ Hospital for further evaluation. On admission on 12/19/08, a CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was done for full staging purposes. The CT scan of the chest showed an abnormal soft tissue mass in the right paratracheal region, extending into the precarinal region, the subcarinal region, and the right hilum. This was causing some compression on the inferior aspect of the SVC and also some narrowing of the right upper lobe pulmonary artery. There was an abnormal lymph node noted in the AP window and left hilar region. There was another spiculated mass within the right upper lobe measuring 2.0 x 1.5 cm. There was also an 8 mm non-calcified nodule noted in the posterior-inferior aspect of the left upper lobe suspicious for metastatic disease. There were areas of atelectasis particularly in the right base. There was also some mild ground glass opacity within the right upper lobe adjacent to the right hilum potentially representing focal area of pulmonary edema versus small infarction related to the right upper lobe pulmonary artery narrowing. There was a small lucency adjacent to the medial aspect of the left upper lobe compatible with a small pneumothorax. In the abdomen, there was a mass involved in the left adrenal gland as well as a nodule involving the right adrenal gland both of which appeared necrotic compatible with metastatic tumor. All other structures appeared normal. On 12/22/08, a CT-guided biopsy of the left adrenal mass was performed. Pathology from this returned showing metastatic poorly differentiated non-small cell carcinoma. At this point, we have been consulted to discuss further treatment options.

On further review, ABCD states that he has may be had a 20 pound weight loss over the last couple of months which he relates to anorexia or decreased appetite. He has not ever had a chronic smoker's cough and still does not have a cough. He has no sputum production or hemoptysis. He and his wife are very anxious about this diagnosis.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: He denies any history of heart disease, lung disease, kidney disease, liver disease, hepatitis major infection, seizure disorders or other problems.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: He denies having any surgeries.

ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS: At home he takes no medication except occasional aspirin or ibuprofen, recently for his flank pain. He does take a multivitamin on occasion.

SOCIAL HISTORY: He has about a 30-pack-a-year history of smoking. He used to drink alcohol heavily and has a history of getting a DUI about a year-and-half ago resulting in him having his truck-driving license revoked. Since that time he has worked with printing press. He is married and has two children, both of whom are grown in their 20s, but are now living at home.

FAMILY HISTORY: His mother died for alcohol-related complications. He otherwise denies any history of cancers, bleeding disorders, clotting disorders, or other problems.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: GENERAL/CONSTITUTIONAL: He has lost about 20 pounds of weight as described above. He also has a trouble with fatigue. No lightheadedness or dizziness. HEENT: He denies any new or changing headache, change in vision, double vision, or loss of vision, ringing in his ears, loss of hearing in one year. He does not take care of his teeth very well but currently he has no mouth, jaw, or teeth pain. RESPIRATORY: He has had some little bit of dyspnea on exertion but otherwise denies shortness of breath at rest. No cough, congestion, wheezing, hemoptysis, and sputum production. CVS: He denies any chest pains, palpitations, PND, orthopnea, or swelling of his lower extremities. GI: He denies any odynophagia, dysphagia, heartburn on a regular basis, abdominal pain, abdominal swelling, diarrhea, blood in his stool, or black tarry stools. He has been somewhat constipated recently. GU: He denies any burning with urination, kidney stones, blood in his urine, dysuria, difficulty getting his urine out or other problems. MUSCULOSKELETAL: He denies any new bony aches or pains including back pain, hip pain, and rib pain. No muscle aches, no joint swelling, and no history of gout. SKIN: No rashes, no bruising, petechia, non-healing wounds, or ulcerations. He has had no nail or hair changes. HEM: He denies any bloody nose, bleeding gums, easy bruising, easy bleeding, swollen lymphs or bumps. ENDOCRINE: He denies any tremor, shakiness, history of diabetes, thyroid problems, new or enlarging stretch marks, exophthalmos, insomnia, or tremors. NEURO: He denies any mental status changes, anxiety, confusion, depression, hallucinations, loss of feeling in her arm or leg, numbness or tingling in hands or feet, loss of balance, syncope, seizures, or loss of coordination.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
VITAL SIGNS: His T-max is 98.8. His pulse is 85, respirations 18, and blood pressure 126/80 saturating over 90% on room air.
GENERAL: No acute distress, pleasant gentleman who appears stated age.
HEENT: NC/AT. Sclerae anicteric. Conjunctiva clear. Oropharynx is clear without erythema, exudate, or discharge.
NECK: Supple. Nontender. No elevated JVP. No carotid bruits. No thyromegaly. No thyroid nodules. Carotids are 2+ and symmetric.
BACK: Spine is straight. No spinal tenderness. No CVA tenderness. No presacral edema.
CHEST: Clear to auscultation and percussion bilaterally. No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi. Normal symmetric chest wall expansion with inspiration.
CVS: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs, gallops, or rubs.
ABDOMEN: Soft, nontender, nondistended. No hepatosplenomegaly. No guarding or rebound. No masses. Normoactive bowel sounds.
EXTREMITIES: No cyanosis, clubbing, or edema. No joint swelling. Full range of motion.
SKIN: No rashes, wounds, ulcerations, bruises, or petechia.
NEUROLOGIC: Cranial nerves II through XII are intact. He has intact sensation to light touch throughout. He has 2+ deep tendon reflexes bilaterally in the biceps, triceps, brachioradialis, patellar and ankle reflexes. He is alert and oriented x3.

LABORATORY DATA: His white blood cell count is 9.4, hemoglobin 13.0, hematocrit 38%, and platelets 365,000. The differential shows 73% neutrophils, 17% lymphocytes, 7.6% monocytes, 1.9% eosinophils, and 0.7% basophils. Chemistry shows sodium 138, potassium 3.8, chloride 104, CO2 of 31, BUN 9, creatinine 1.0, glucose 104, calcium 12.3, alkaline phosphatase 104, AST 16, ALT 12, total protein 7.6, albumin 3.5, total bilirubin 0.5, ionized calcium 1.7. His INR is 1.0 with the PT of 11.4 and a PTT of 31.3.

IMAGINING DATA: MRI of the brain on 12/23/08 - this shows some mild white matter disease, question of minimal pontine ischemic gliosis as well as a small incidental venous angioma in the left posterior frontal deep white matter. There is no evidence of cerebral metastasis, hemorrhage, or acute infarction.

ASSESSMENT/PLAN: ABCD is a very nice 47-year-old gentleman without much past medical history, who now presents with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. At this point, he and his wife ask about whether this is curable disease and it was difficult to inform that this was not curable disease but would be treatable. His wife particularly had a very hard time with this prognosis. They preferred not to know the exact average as to how long someone lives with this disease. I did offer chemotherapy as a way to treat this disease. Chemotherapy has been associated both with palliation of symptoms as well as prolong survival. At this point, he has an excellent functional status and I think he would tolerate chemotherapy quite well.

In terms of chemotherapy, I talked briefly about the side affects including but not limited to GI upset, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, mucositis, fatigue, loss of appetite, low blood counts including the possible need for transfusion as well as the risk of infections, which in some rare cases can be fatal. I would likely use carboplatin and gemcitabine. This would be both medications given on day 1 with a dose of gemcitabine on day 8. This cycle will be repeated after 1-week break so that the cycle lasts 21 days. The goal will be to complete 6 cycles of this as long as he is responding and tolerating the medication.

In terms of staging Mr. ABCD'S had all the appropriate staging. A PET-CT scan could be done, but at this point would not provide much mean full information beyond the CT scans that we have.

At this point, his biggest issue is pain and he is getting a pain consult to help control his pain. He will be ready to be discharged from the hospital once his pain is under better control. As this is the holiday weekend, I do not have a way of scheduling a followup appointment with them, but I did give he and his wife my card and instructed them to call on Monday. At that point, we will get him in and I will also begin working on making arrangements for his chemotherapy.

Thank you very much for this interesting consult.

"",,,,,,,"CHIEF COMPLAINT: Itchy rash.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This 34-year-old gentleman awoke this morning noting some itchiness to his back and then within very a short period of time realized that he had an itchy rash all over his torso and arms. No facial swelling. No tongue or lip swelling. No shortness of breath, wheezing, or other associated symptoms. He cannot think of anything that could have triggered this off. There have been no changes in his foods, medications, or other exposures as far as he knows. He states a couple of days ago he did work and was removing some insulation but does not remember feeling itchy that day.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Negative for chronic medical problems. No local physician. Has had previous back surgery and appendectomy, otherwise generally healthy.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: As mentioned denies any oropharyngeal swelling. No lip or tongue swelling. No wheezing or shortness of breath. No headache. No nausea. Notes itchy rash, especially on his torso and upper arms.

SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is accompanied with his wife.

FAMILY HISTORY: Negative.

MEDICATIONS: None.

ALLERGIES: TORADOL, MORPHINE, PENICILLIN, AND AMPICILLIN.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: The patient was afebrile. He is slightly tachycardic, 105, but stable blood pressure and respiratory rate. GENERAL: The patient is in no distress. Sitting quietly on the gurney. HEENT: Unremarkable. His oral mucosa is moist and well hydrated. Lips and tongue look normal. Posterior pharynx is clear. NECK: Supple. His trachea is midline. There is no stridor. LUNGS: Very clear with good breath sounds in all fields. There is no wheezing. Good air movement in all lung fields. CARDIAC: Without murmur. Slight tachycardia. ABDOMEN: Soft, nontender. SKIN: Notable for a confluence erythematous, blanching rash on the torso as well as more of a blotchy papular, macular rash on the upper arms. He noted some on his buttocks as well. Remaining of the exam is unremarkable.

ED COURSE: The patient was treated with epinephrine 1:1000, 0.3 mL subcutaneously along with 50 mg of Benadryl intramuscularly. After about 15-20 minutes he states that itching started to feel better. The rash has started to fade a little bit and feeling a lot more comfortable.

IMPRESSION: ACUTE ALLERGIC REACTION WITH URTICARIA AND PRURITUS.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: The patient has what looks to be some type of allergic reaction, although the underlying cause is difficult to assess. He will make sure he goes home to look around to see if there is in fact anything that changed recently that could have triggered this off. In the meantime, I think he can be managed with some antihistamine over-the-counter. He is responding already to Benadryl and the epinephrine that we gave him here. He is told that if he develops any respiratory complaints, shortness of breath, wheezing, or tongue or lip swelling he will return immediately for evaluation. He is discharged in stable condition.

"",,,,,,,"REASON FOR THE CONSULT: Nonhealing right ankle stasis ulcer.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 52-year-old native American-Indian man with hypertension, chronic intermittent bipedal edema, and recurrent leg venous ulcers, who was admitted on 01/27/09 for scheduled vascular surgery per Dr. X. I was consulted for nonhealing right ankle stasis ulcer. There is a concern that the patient had a low-grade fever of 100.2 early this morning. The patient otherwise feels well. He was not even aware of the fever. He does have some ankle pain, worse on the right than the left. Old medical records were reviewed. He has multiple hospitalizations for leg cellulitis. Multiple wound cultures have repeatedly grown Pseudomonas, Enterococcus, and Stenotrophomonas in the past. Klebsiella and Enterobacter have also grown in the few wound cultures at some point. The patient has been following up at the wound center as an outpatient and was referred to Dr. X for definitive surgical management.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
CONSTITUTIONAL: No malaise. Positive recent low-grade fevers. No chills.
HEENT: No acute change in visual acuity, no diplopia, no acute hearing disturbances, and no sinus congestion. No sore throat.
CARDIAC: No chest pain or cough.
GASTROINTESTINAL: No nausea, vomiting or diarrhea.
All other systems were reviewed and were negative.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hypertension, exploratory laparotomy in 2004 for abdominal obstruction, cholecystectomy in 2005, chronic intermittent bipedal edema, venous insufficiency, chronic recurrent stasis ulcers.

SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient admits to heavy alcohol drinking in the past, quit several years ago. He is also a former cigarette smoker, quit several years ago.

ALLERGIES: None known.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Primaxin, daptomycin, clonidine, furosemide, potassium chloride, lisinopril, metoprolol, ranitidine, Colace, amlodipine, zinc sulfate, Lortab p.r.n., multivitamins with minerals.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
CONSTITUTIONAL/VITAL SIGNS: Heart rate 73, respiratory rate 20, blood pressure 104/67, temperature 98.3, and oxygen saturation 92% on room air.
GENERAL APPEARANCE: The patient is awake, alert, and not in cardiorespiratory distress. Height 6 feet 1.5 inches, body weight 125.26 kilos.
EYES: Pink conjunctivae, anicteric sclerae. Pupils equal, brisk reaction to light.
EARS, NOSE, MOUTH AND THROAT: Intact gross hearing. Moist oral mucosa. No oral lesions.

GASTROINTESTINAL: Normoactive bowel sounds. Soft. No guarding or rigidity.
LYMPHATIC: No cervical lymphadenopathy.
MUSCULOSKELETAL: Good range of motion of upper and lower extremities.
SKIN: There is hyperpigmentation involving the distal calf of both legs. There is an open wound on the right medial
malleolar area measuring 9 x 5cm with minimal serous drainage. Periwound is hyperpigmented with a hint of erythema extending proximally to the medial aspect, distal third of the right lower leg. There is warmth, but minimal tenderness on palpation of this area. There is also a wound on the right lateral malleolar area measuring 4 x 3 cm, another open wound on the left medial malleolar area measuring 7 x 4 cm. Wound edges are poorly defined.
PSYCHIATRIC: Appropriate mood and affect, oriented x3. Fair judgment and insight.

LABORATORY RESULTS: White blood cell count from 01/28/09 is 5.8 with 64% neutrophils, H&H 11.3/33.8, and platelet count 176,000. BUN and creatinine 9.2/0.52. Albumin 3.6, AST 25, ALT 9, alk phos 87, and total bilirubin 0.6. One wound culture from right leg wound culture from 01/27/09 noted with young growth. Left leg wound culture from 01/27/09 also with young growth.

RADIOLOGY: Chest x-ray done on 01/28/09 showed chronic bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis likely related to elevated hemidiaphragm secondary to chronic ileus. No absolute findings.

IMPRESSION:
1. Fevers.
2. Right leg/ankle cellulitis.
3. Chronic recurrent bilateral ankle venous ulcers.
4. Multiple previous wound cultures positive for Pseudomonas, Enterococcus, and Stenotrophomonas.
5. Hypertension.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. We have ordered 2 sets of blood cultures.
2. Agree with daptomycin and Primaxin IV.
3. Follow up result of wound cultures.
4. I will order an MRI of the right ankle to check for underlying osteomyelitis.

Additional ID recommendations as appropriate upon followup.
